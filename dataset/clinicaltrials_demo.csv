NCT05042479,Using of Virtual Reality to Relieve Procedural Pain in Pediatric Oncology.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05042479,VIRTUOSO,RECRUITING,"Medical procedures can be a very frightening experience for children. It is known that children who received painful medical procedures can develop a higher sensitivity of pain during their following experiences.

During their treatments for malignant diseases, children are exposed to a lot of painful procedures (eg. needle insertion, lumbar punction, myelogram, etc...)

Therefore, medical societies propose the use of interventions like distraction techniques for pain management in complement of pharmacological treatment.

In addition, the repetitions of painful procedures and ineffective prevention of pain can create care phobia.

Within this context, immersive and participative virtual reality (VR) could be an innovative distraction technique for pain management among children undergoing medical procedures.

Attention Pain Theory can explain how virtual reality can reduce the perception of pain. Attention is required to feel pain. When the patient is focused on another subject like an immersive virtual environment, his brain is less available to treat information like painful stimulus from care procedures.

The investigators hypothesis is that VR can reduce procedural-related pain and can decrease fear during the following procedures.

Results of previous studies are varied : some showed a non-significant reduction of patient's procedural pain despite the use of VR, whereas others concluded to a decrease of pain. The question of the benefit of VR for the patients who are exposed to repeated painful procedures remains still unclear, especially with patients who are likely to feel chronic pain or many pain-related exposures.

There is a growing need for home-based end-of-life and palliative care for children with serious illnesses. While palliative care interventions offered in home settings are significantly lacking, the problems are magnified by substantial gaps in access to palliative care for rural populations. Web-based recruitment and intervention methods have the potential to access hard-to-reach rural populations and provide a cost-effective health care. In particular, legacy-making (i.e., actions/behaviors aimed at being remembered) is one strategy to help decrease suffering and improve psychosocial outcomes for children with serious illness and end of life needs.

Matching the patient's respiratory needs with adequate ventilator settings is necessary to ensure a low work of breathing (WOB) and maximal patient comfort. The inspiratory rise time (IRT) determines the time to reach the selected airway pressure. A short IRT results in a high peak inspiratory flow and a short time to reach that peak, but is also associated with the development of turbulent flow, resulting in increased WOB. Aim of this study is to investigate the effects of different IRT settings on WOB and patient comfort during pressure support ventilation.

Methods We will performed a prospective, single blind cohort study in patients on Pressure Support Ventilation. 10 healthy adult patients admitted to the ICU after elective facial or neck surgery will be included. All patients will be ventilated in pressure support mode using a Servo 300 ventilator (Siemens. Elema, Solna, Sweden), with a positive end expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O, pressure support level of 12 cm H2O above PEEP and an inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0.40. Patients have to be awake and cooperative (Ramsay 2). WOB will be measured with an esophageal balloon, and miniature flowmeter (Bicore system). Breathing comfort will be evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 1 to 10. WOB and patient comfort will be measured (in random order) at 0, 5, and 10% IRT.

NCT01499979,Hypothermic Perfusion During Hemihepatectomy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01499979,,COMPLETED,"Rationale

Currently, hepatic resection is often the only curative treatment for primary or secondary hepatic malignancies and is also frequently performed in patients with benign liver tumors to prevent malignant transformation and/or alleviate symptoms. Liver resections are nowadays associated with low mortality and acceptable morbidity. As result of that, an increasing number of patients is currently under consideration for resection of more complex or large tumors, thus requiring extensive resection procedures. Application of vascular exclusion (i.e., clamping of the portal vein and hepatic artery) during such procedures reduces blood loss, which is one of the most important factors affecting peri-operative outcomes. However, vascular exclusion leads to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury as an inevitable side-effect, which adversely impacts postoperative liver function and regeneration. Additional cooling of the liver by means of hypothermic perfusion is expected to further reduce intraoperative blood loss, as well as to protect the liver from I/R injury. Therefore, the aim of this pilot study is to cool the future remnant liver (FRL) in situ during right hemihepatectomy under vascular exclusion. Consequently, an overall improvement in postoperative outcomes is expected due to a decrease in intraoperative blood loss, reduced parenchymal damage, and a better ability of the liver remnant to regenerate.

Objective

To reduce intraoperative blood loss and enhance tolerance of the FRL to I/R injury during right hemihepatectomy under vascular exclusion by means of in situ hypothermic perfusion with retrograde outflow (R-IHP) of the FRL.

Study design

The study is designed as a prospective randomized pilot study in 18 patients (9 interventions and 9 controls) to assess the effects of the proposed intervention. Additionally, 4 patients will be included separately for assessment of the intervention's feasibility prior to randomized inclusion.

Study population

NCT04090879,Low Nicotine Content Cigarettes in Vulnerable Populations: Affective Disorders,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04090879,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"While the prevalence of smoking in the United States general population has declined over the past 50 years, there has been little to no decline among people with mental health conditions. Affective Disorders (ADs) are the most common mental health conditions in the US, and over 40% of people with ADs are current smokers. A national policy of reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes has the potential to reduce tobacco use, dependence, and related adverse health outcomes. Controlled trials in psychiatrically-stable smokers have shown that reducing the nicotine content in cigarettes can reduce cigarettes per day (CPD), dependence and tobacco toxicant exposure, with few adverse consequences.

The goal of the proposed trial is to experimentally model whether increasing the availability and appeal of an alternative, non-combusted source of nicotine (e-cigarettes) moderates the effect of altering the nicotine in cigarettes in smokers with ADs. Additionally, investigators will test whether allowing participants to personalize the flavor of the e-liquid alters any moderating effects their availability may have on tobacco cigarette smoking.

Daily smokers with current ADs will be recruited at Brown University and the University of Vermont.

Investigators will study two research cigarettes referred to here as Research Cigarette 1 (RC1) and Research Cigarette 2 (RC2). One of these cigarettes will be a normal nicotine content cigarette and the other will be a reduced nicotine content cigarette. Investigators will study two e-cigarette conditions referred to here as E-Cigarette Condition 1 (EC1) and E-Cigarette Condition 2 (EC2). Both e-cigarette conditions will involve the same commercially available devices and same nicotine-containing e-liquid, but in one condition that e-liquid will be available only in tobacco flavor while in the other condition that e-liquid will be available in multiple flavors from which participants can choose based on personal taste preference. Participants will be assigned to one of the following four study conditions: (1) RC1 only; (2) RC2 only; (3) RC2 + EC1; (4) RC2 + EC2.

Participants will be asked to use only their assigned study products for 16 weeks. Outcome measures include total CPD, cigarette demand assessed by behavioral economics-based purchase tasks, craving, withdrawal, psychiatric symptoms, breath carbon monoxide (CO), biomarkers of tobacco toxicant exposure, brain function and structure, and airway inflammation (fractional nitric oxide concentration in exhaled breath \[FeNO\]).",NO,Tobacco Use Disorder,OTHER: Either normal nicotine content cigarettes (15.8mg/g) or reduced nicotine content cigarettes (0.4mg/g)|OTHER: E-Cigarettes,"Cigarettes Per Day, 16 weeks",,Brown University,Food and Drug Administration (FDA)|National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)|University of Vermont,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,232,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE",2019-09-18,2024-01,2024-01,2019-09-16,,2023-08-18,"Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, 02912, United States|University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, 05401, United States",

It has been developed to standardize the process of vitrification and to increase the safety of the procedure. It has been demonstrated that the novel semiautomated, closed vitrification system providing standardized equilibration prior to cryopreservation can produce similar results in terms of recovery rate and Embryo development up to the blastocyst stage as compared to the commonly used Manual Cryotop® open vitrifcation system when applied in a mouse model.

Furthermore, its application has resulted in first pregnancies after transfer of vitrifiedwarmed biopsied human blastocyts. Due to limitations of the preliminary studies (application in mouse model; absence of a larger clinical Trial assessing pregnancy and live birth rates in human model etc.) it is of paramount importance to compare the GAVI® vitrification method to the routinely used Cryotop® method in a human IVF setting employing randomization and a-priori sample size definitions.

NCT03111979,The Effects of 4 Week β-alanine Supplementation on Knee Extensor Contractile and Force Properties in the Over 60s,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03111979,,SUSPENDED,"The older population is the fastest growing age group worldwide, but it is also the most susceptible to chronic diseases and disabilities. One of the most common negative consequences of aging is the decline in muscle mass, strength and power. This is most notable in lower limb muscles. These muscles are required for the performance of daily activities including walking, stair climbing and standing up from sitting. Regular exercise is considered one of the most effective measures to slow, and even reverse the progression of muscle weakness. Nevertheless older adults may notice a decline in their capability to undertake regular exercises, this may be due to a decline in their muscle's ability to buffer pH. Carnosine (made by bonding β-alanine and histidine) has been suggested to contribute to the extension of physical performance, counteracting the decline the muscle's ability to buffer pH. Yet this pH buffering process it largely restricted by the amount of β-alanine available in the human body. β-alanine is already known to decline in older individuals due to a reduction in food products (meat, fish and poultry). Yet through either consumption of β-alanine rich food, or through short-term supplementation, β-alanine is raised, increasing carnosine concentrations. Improved β-alanine levels can potentially advance exercise performance, for example significant improvements in time to exhaustion on both a constant (37%) and incremental (12%) treadmill tests have been demonstrated. It is therefore proposed that via β-alanine supplementation, an individual's perception of their frailty, maintenance of health and independent living can be improved in older individuals.

However, these findings are based on participants, both young and older, who are well-rested with no prior exercise or fatigue to the assessed muscles. It remains unclear if β-alanine supplementation will aid in the buffering of pH when the muscle has already been fatigued. Therefore this investigation hopes to examine the effects of 4 week β-alanine supplementation on lower limb contractile and force properties, pre and post muscle specific fatigue.",NO,Muscle Function,DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: beta-alanine|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Placebo,"Half relaxation time, The time taken to decline to 50% maximum following a evoked twitch contraction, 4 weeks","Force frequency relationship, Assessed during electrically evoked contractions, 4 weeks|Time to peak tension, The time taken to reach peak in evoked twitch contractions, 4 weeks|Electromechanical delay, The time between EMG onset and force onset in twitch contractions, 4 weeks|Maximal voluntary force production, The maximal force produced during a voluntary isometric contraction, 4 weeks|Explosive voluntary force production, The quickest rate of force developed during voluntary isometric contractions at greater than 80% of voluntary maximum, with no pre-tension or swinging back of the assessed leg., 4 weeks",Nottingham Trent University,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE4,24,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE",2014-04,2018-04,2018-10,2017-04-13,,2017-04-13,,

To track observed inpatient compliance with applying parafilm, data fields were added to the entered to the nursing charts of the participant's electronic medical record (EMR). The primary field added was a no/question about parafilm applied. Per study protocol, the intent was to document nursing changing of the parafilm, at the time it was changed.

This study aims to examine if the developed preoperative intervention (i) reduces preoperative anxiety, (ii) increases positive expectations, and (iii) improves the long-term outcome and postoperative recovery. Therefore an online-tool has been developed. Using an online-approach makes it possible to reach many patients taking as little time and cost as possible.

Patients who undergo surgery in the next two weeks and want to participate in the study will be asked for the planned surgical procedure. There will be a filter (stratum) for surgery. Patients with the same kind of surgery are randomized into two groups (Control vs. intervention group) after they've filled some questionnaires at the baseline assessment.

Objective: To determine the appropriate nurse: patient ratio for peritoneal dialysis unit. Method: This research will be developed in two phases. The first with an observational design with descriptive and qualitative approach. There will be a focus group with experts in the field, to defined the activities and responsibilities of the peritoneal dialysis nurse, and produce a tool with a list of activities. A time-orientated score will be created. In the second stage a cross-sectional quantitative approach will be used.

With the instrument activities will be timed and the overall time of each nursing activity will be determined by multiplying the time spent by the total number of patients. It is expected tat this strategy will increase time on treatment and/or decrease dropout rates, by developing an easy test/ formula application to determine the correct ratio according to the peritoneal dialysis program.

NCT05474079,Exercise Training & Statins for Cardiovascular Health,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05474079,EXSTATIC,RECRUITING,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) refers to any condition that affects the heart and/or blood vessels (e.g. heart attack, stroke) and is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Regular exercise and statin therapy are widely recommended as frontline prevention strategies to reduce CVD risk. Recent changes to National Health Service (NHS) healthcare guidelines state that even individuals with a relatively low risk of CVD (≥10% risk score) should take a statin. When prescribed after a heart attack or stroke, both exercise and statins reduce the risk of a CVD-related death by \~25%, with some evidence to suggest that the combination of these therapies may offer additive cardiovascular protection. However, far less is known about the combined effects of exercise and statin therapy in primary CVD prevention (i.e. before a CVD event). Poor blood vessel function represents the earliest stage of CVD, which can be measured with ultrasound at different regions of the body (limbs, brain, heart) to sensitively detect early CVD risk. Regular exercise provides a variety of cardiovascular benefits and has a direct therapeutic effect on blood vessel function. In contrast, statin therapy primarily reduces CVD risk by lowering cholesterol, which may also improve blood vessel function. Although both therapies can separately reduce CVD risk, the interaction between exercise training and statin therapy on blood vessel function has never been directly compared in the setting of primary prevention, and it's currently unknown whether a combination of both therapies offers additional cardiovascular benefit. Therefore, the main aims of this study are to (i) investigate the effect of supervised exercise training on blood vessel function (limbs, brain, heart) in individuals with a CVD-risk score of ≥10% and (ii) examine whether these exercise effects differ in individuals taking a statin compared to those not taking a statin.",NO,Risk Reduction|Cardiovascular Diseases,OTHER: Moderate intensity exercise training,"Change in Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD), Brachial artery FMD, as a non-invasive measure of endothelial nitric oxide function, will be assessed using high resolution Duplex vascular ultrasonography in accordance with published guidelines., Pre and post intervention (12 weeks)","Change in sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) induced dilatation, Sublingual Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN): Following 10 minutes of supine rest, endothelium independent vasodilator function will be assessed simultaneously in the brachial and carotid artery. A 1-minute baseline recording of the brachial and carotid artery will be acquired on the same high-resolution ultrasound device before sublingual administration of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN; 400µg). GTN is a nitric oxide donor that will cause the arteries to vasodilate allowing a short-lived increase in blood flow. Both the brachial and carotid artery will be imaged for 10-minutes following the administration of GTN and peak diameter and blood flow will be recorded. GTN has been used for many decades in clinical and research work in this and other populations., Pre and post intervention (12 weeks)|Change in cold pressor induced dilatation, Cold Pressor Test: Following 15 minutes supine rest, carotid artery reactivity (CAR) to a sympathetic stimulation produced by the cold pressor test (CPT) will be measured. The same ultrasound probe will be repositioned onto the participant's neck and an image of the carotid artery will be recorded continuously for one minute before and then during 3 minutes of hand-to-wrist submersion in ice cold water (4 °C). After the 3 minute CPT, the participant will then remove their hand from the cold water and we will continue to image the carotid artery for an additional 3 minutes. Peak carotid artery diameter and blood flow velocity, and the time taken to reach these peaks during the CPT will be recorded. This procedure has been shown to be reliable and well tolerated in this population., Pre and post intervention (12 weeks)|Change in arterial stiffness, Carotid - femoral pulse wave velocity (CF-PWV) will be recorded following 15 minutes of supine rest via applanation tonometry.

NCT05827679,Creation and Validation of a Clinical Evaluation Scale for Abdominal Condition of the Premature (ECAP),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05827679,ECAP,COMPLETED,"Every year in France, 60,000 children are born prematurely (before 37 weeks of amenorrhea), and present an immaturity of their various systems, in particular the digestive system. This can result in feeding intolerance, which is expressed by abdominal distension, regurgitation or vomiting, irregular transit and abdominal discomfort. This feeding intolerance influences the length of hospitalization and can lead to necrotising enterocolitis, a major complication.

In the Neonatal Intensive Care Units of Clermont-Ferrand hospital center, abdominal massages have been performed by physiotherapists for several years in order to improve the condition of the digestive system. However, the indication for abdominal massage is very dependent on the caregivers in charge of the newborn and the evaluation of the abdominal condition remains subjective with a great variability between examiners. Thus, some newborns will receive massage multiple times a day while others will not.

Developmental care is essential for these premature infants, especially to avoid over-stimulation. It is important not to add care, such as massage, if it is not needed. It is therefore essential to properly assess the digestive status of premature babies in order to determine whether they have feeding intolerance and whether they require treatment with abdominal massage.

A non-union is a lack of bone healing (bone growth where the break in the bone occurred) after 3 months after the operation. The diaphyseal is an area of a specific bone (usually near the middle) where the fracture occurred. The bones we are interested in are the clavicle (collar bone), tibia (lower leg), femur (upper leg), humerus (upper arm) and forearm (lower arm). Treatment goals for these types of fractures are to minimize later surgeries, to assist the healing process, and to decrease the time to healing. The ability of a patient with non-union (lack of bone healing after 3 months post operation) to return to the work force and to normal activities more quickly not only has a good financial impact on society (community), but also improves over-all physical and mental well-being of the patients.

""Infuse"" is a synthetic bone morphogenic protein which means it has the ability to help your bone to form and heal if inserted in the fracture site. ""Infuse"" may be the first commercially available product approved by Health Canada to accelerate the healing of long bone non-unions requiring surgical intervention.

Although the safety and efficacy of Infuse has been demonstrated through numerous pre-clinical studies, further human clinical trial is needed to evaluate the safety and the power to produce effects of this product particularly with respect to non unions of long bones. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the power to produce effects of Infuse implanted during treatment of long bone non unions to reduce later surgeries required to augment the healing process and to accelerate the time to healing.

Despite the immense needs, there is a severe lack of culturally appropriate, evidence-based interventions to support the resilience and well-being of these vulnerable populations.

To fill this gap, the study will evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of a novel life skills education (LSE) program delivered through two innovative approaches: in-person peer support groups and WhatsApp-based virtual support groups. The LSE curriculum, developed through extensive community engagement, covers topics such as stress management, communication, problem-solving, health, safety, and advocacy, all tailored to the unique challenges of displacement.

In the in-person arm, trained IDP peers and local providers will facilitate weekly group sessions over 12 weeks, providing a safe space for participants to learn, practice, and apply new skills while building social connections and support networks. In the WhatsApp arm, participants will receive weekly messages with educational content, reflection prompts, and exercises, moderated by trained facilitators to foster dialogue and peer support.

By comparing these two delivery methods, the study aims to identify the most feasible, acceptable, and effective strategies for rolling out psychosocial support interventions in humanitarian settings, particularly those with limited resources and access. The study will also assess the interventions' impact on key mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and well-being, as well as life skills, functioning, and implementation metrics such as reach, adoption, and sustainability.

Ultimately, the RESETTLE-IDPs study seeks to generate actionable evidence to inform the development and scale-up of culturally responsive, community-driven interventions that can promote the mental health and resilience of conflict-affected populations in Nigeria and beyond.

NCT03444779,"Comparative Evaluation of Minimally Invasive ""Tibial Tuberoplasty"" Surgical Technique Versus Conventional Open Surgery for Tibial Plateau Fractures",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03444779,TUBERIMPACT,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"PMSI (French Medico-Administrative Database) data shows more than 10000 proximal tibial fractures diagnosed in 2014 and 4055 lateral tibial plateau fractures operated in 2013 in France. 50% of these surgical fractures is related to the lateral condyle and causes split/depression (Schatzker 2) or pure depression (Schatzker 3). This high rate results from the recent democratization of high-risk sports, as well as an aging population with increased risks of falling. Aside from the resulting reduced physical activity, the social and professional impact of these fractures is undeniable and represents significant costs for our health care system. A recently published prospective case series reports 28 job losses out of 41 patients treated.

The clinical outcome of these patients depends mainly on the primary stability provided by the surgical treatment, after the greatest anatomical reduction possible. Indeed, Giannoudis and al. have demonstrated that under simple X-rays, the smaller the detected step-off, the better the outcome.The aim is to allow for recovery of good joint mobility to promote rapid resumption of activity and to limit the onset of early osteoarthritis.

The classical technique used for reduction and osteosynthesis of tibial plateau fractures (open surgical technique using a bone tamp) has several pitfalls : devascularization of the bone and skin, risks of infection and functional rehabilitation difficulties with delayed recovery of weight bearing. Moreover, this technique does not allow for the simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of other possible lesions, such as meniscal injuries in particular.

Since 2011, Poitiers University Hospital is offering to its patients a new minimally invasive technique for the reduction and stabilization of tibial plateau fractures, baptized ""Tibial Tuberoplasty"". The concept derives from the divergent use of vertebral kyphoplasty, initially dedicated for spinal injuries and transposed here to the tibial plateau. This technique involves expansion of the tibial plateau through inflation of a kyphoplasty balloon, filling of the created cavity with cement (PMMA, calcium phosphate) and percutaneous screw fixation.

Orthopaedic surgeons of Poitiers University Hospital performed the first tibial tuberoplasties through a feasibility study on 36 cadaveric subjects and then transposed the technique to human. Surgeons identified major advantages such as minimal skin damage, possible treatment of posterior and multi-fragmented compressions (lifting in a single block by the balloon), reinforcement of the stability of the assembly using cement, possible use of combined arthroscopy (for concomitant meniscal injuries treatment).

This technique allows for optimization of the fracture reduction by elevating the posterior fragments with the inflatable bone tamp through an anterior approach. The reduction is made possible thanks to the specificity of the inflatable bone tamp which inflates and reduces the area of least resistance.

The aim of this innovative technique is focused on the anatomical reduction in order to restore the convexity of the tibial plateau which is similar to the balloon convexity.

The results from the first 40 patients operated since 2011 are promising and show a proportion of 70% presenting less than 5 mm step-off reduction. A larger scale multicenter randomized controlled trial is now requested to further demonstrate the superiority of the ""Tibial Tuberoplasty"" to the standard treatment.

Veteran suicide rates exceed those of the general population, with the disorder creating a mental health challenge that is costly and debilitating. The majority of Veterans with PTSD also have comorbid mental health diagnoses, such as generalized anxiety disorder, substance abuse disorder, and major depression. The treatment of Veteran PTSD and comorbid disorders represents an important therapeutic and rehabilitation problem. The disorder is complex and difficult to treat, with high treatment dropout and nonresponse rates spurring some Veterans to seek complementary integrative health strategies. One promising complementary strategy is the provision of a trained service dog. Initial evidence across multiple research groups highlights service dogs as a promising complement to evidence-based practices that can offer short-term improvements. However, the long-term effectiveness, mechanisms of action, and moderators of efficacy remain largely unknown. Thus, the overarching objective of this proposal is to understand how, why, and for whom PTSD service dogs are most effective.

To address this objective, the present project will assess the longitudinal efficacy and dose-response curve of service dogs for Veteran PTSD symptomology and psychosocial functioning. The research design will consist of a two-arm, randomized clinical trial (RCT) with longitudinal assessments at 0, 3, 9, and 15 months. Results are expected to elucidate the clinical impact of service dogs for military Veterans with PTSD, as well as the biobehavioral mechanisms of action and characteristics that moderate efficacy. These outcomes will support the long-term goal of accelerating complementary and integrative health interventions, through optimized and evidence-based service dog interventions.

To achieve the study objectives, researchers will conduct an explanatory sequential mixed methods design using extensive quantitative data collection procedures, namely, cross-sectional surveys and measures that will identify predictors and moderators of health literacy with Deaf and hearing subjects. These results will inform the subsequent qualitative assessment using elicitation interviews that will help explain the quantitative results, and elucidate how and why Deaf individuals access and understand health information. A community advisory board consisting of Deaf community members will provide oversight to the proposal that will be led by multiple Deaf investigators, including the PI. The Deaf community, due to communication barriers, relative social marginalization, and their reliance on visual learning, provides a unique insight into how health information is distributed and disseminated visually.

NCT02409979,Impact of Carbon Dioxide Insufflation and Water Exchange on Post-Colonoscopy Outcomes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02409979,,COMPLETED,"Room air insufflated during colonoscopy cannot be completely suctioned, is not easily absorbed and remains in the bowel for quite some time, resulting in prolonged bowel distension with the discomfort of bloating. Sufferers often experience a sensation of fullness and abdominal pressure, relieved only after expulsion of the residual gas, often accompanied by colic pain. This can be a lengthy process, and some patients continue to report pain as long as 24 hours after the procedure. Abdominal discomfort after colonoscopy is an adverse event commonly reported by patients, and definitely associated with the procedure. Published reports show that the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation significantly decreases bloating and pain up to 24 hours post-procedure. Preliminary results of the investigators' previous study about on-demand sedation colonoscopy in diagnostic patients showed that, compared with CO2 insufflation, the water exchange group (WE, infusion of water to distend the lumen during insertion; suction of infused water, residual air pockets an feces predominantly during insertion) achieved significantly lower real-time insertion pain scores. Moreover (insertion-withdrawal method) WE-CO2 had the lowest bloating scores just after the procedure and at discharge, comparable with those achieved by CO2-CO2. Compared with WE-CO2, the use of WE-air insufflation (AI) showed significantly higher bloating scores just after the procedure and at discharge; compared with CO2-CO2 differences were significant only at discharge. The investigators decided to conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing WE-CO2, WE-AI and CO2-CO2. The investigators will test the hypothesis that patients examined by the combination of WE-CO2 will have significantly lower bloating scores at specific time points after colonoscopy than those examined using WE-AI or CO2-CO2.

In healthy humans during muscle contraction, there is a blunting of skeletal muscle vascular responsiveness to increases in MSNA. However, the exact mechanisms involved are unknown although, best evidence suggests that the mechanism is endothelium derived, but nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin (PG) independent. Endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) is a NO and PG independent vasodilator in both cerebral and skeletal muscle circulations, however, it is unknown if EDHF contributes to vascular responsiveness during elevated MSNA. The application of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) is a safe and non-invasive manipulation that can be used to increase MSNA causing vasoconstriction in humans. Therefore, the purpose of this experiment is to determine if acute inhibition of EDHF alters central and peripheral vascular responses to LBNP at rest and during dynamic exercise.

Physical therapy intervention in the form of exercise is commonly directed at improving muscular performance, however, neuromuscular adaptations may limit the effectiveness of traditional strengthening exercises. Manual therapy techniques have been used as a disinhibitory intervention to increase muscle activation and strength before participating in strengthening exercises or performing functional tasks While there is recent evidence to support joint mobilization as a valuable manual therapy disinhibitory intervention Currently, there is no evidence to substantiate anecdotal experience that a HVLAT hip distraction mobilization improves muscle performance in subjects with lower extremity pathology and lower extremity weakness. The purpose of this study was to determine if a HVLAT hip distraction mobilization would result in an immediate change of maximal force output of the quadriceps, gluteus maximus and gluteus medius.

Methods: Forty individuals with a lower extremity pathology volunteered for this study. Inclusion criteria were having a unilateral musculoskeletal pathology, being greater than 18 years of age, 10% decrease in muscle strength in symptomatic side compared to healthy side, and absence of medical precautions that would prevent a maximal effort strength test and exclusion criteria included individuals with a history lower extremity recent muscle or tendon ruptures (within the past 6 months) and postoperative knee, hip and ankle surgery.

When assessing pain, as other subjective symptoms, the challenge is twofold because the assessment is dependent on patient's understanding and use of the scale, all the more so in children

So far, attempts to improve pain assessments have been focused on the development and refining pain scales. No emphasis has been placed on improving patient's ability to report their pain. Our purpose is to evaluate a training program designed to improve the quality of children's post-surgical pain intensity reports.

After receiving Helsinki approval, eligible children and their parents will signed informed-consent. After surgery, the children, their parents, and the department nurses will assess children's pain intensity. Immediately after the nurse assessment, parents will assess their child's pain (blindly and independently) and the children will report their pain on four different pain scales.

NCT00553579,The Relationship of Residence Time and Visual Effect of Optive and Systane in Dry Eye Subjects,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00553579,,COMPLETED,"The benefits of artificial tears to relieve dry eye symptoms include, but are not limited to: stabilizing the tear film layer, fluid supplement action, improving visual acuity, and comfort. Studies have found a relationship between some of these benefits. For example, stabilization of the tear film is important not only to increase the tear break up time (TBUT), but is key in improving and maintaining visual acuity. These studies have alluded to the fact that there may or may not be a relationship between residence time and visual performance. Viscosity is one reason behind the uncertainty. Some solutions contain polymers which influence the ocular surface when contacted. This can impact residence time and ultimately visual performance. No prior research has explored the direct relationship between residence time and visual performance.

Residence time refers to the duration at which the artificial tear resides on the eye. Methods have been developed to assess residence time by admixing fluorescent tracers to the solution and then measuring the amount of fluorescence over time. The caveat to methods using certain tracers has lead to uncertainty in elimination measurements due to corneal penetration or differing molecular weights (MW) from the active vehicle ingredient in the solution. For example, low-MW tracers can be eliminated at a different rate than higher-MW polymers. In addition, the low-MW tracers may be able to penetrate the corneal epithelium giving a false pre-corneal residence time. Meadows, Paugh, Joshi, and Mordaunt addressed this issue by developing a technique using a polymer which did not penetrate the cornea and had the same MW as the active ingredient in the solution FITC-dextran. Based on the assumption that similar weights are eliminated at the same rate, this technique has shown to be more economic, manageable, and amendable than previous procedures measuring residence time.

Any ophthalmic drop has the potential to impact visual acuity upon instillation due to the effect it has on the tear layer components. Studies have observed that taking artificial tears continuously over time tends to stabilize the tear layer thus minimizing the immediate drop in contrast sensitivity upon instillation. Measuring the visual effect of artificial tears, using contrast sensitivity as a measure, provides valuable information about the therapeutic effect of artificial tears that are meant to stabilize the tear film, thus improving visual acuity in dry eye patients.

But what about the patient? There is a difference between residence time and retention of effect- which is often what matters the most for patients. Retention of effect refers to the beneficial effect of the drop. Currently there is no real measure of retention of effect. Doctors can assess the tear film objectively, but there have been no strong correlations between subjective dry symptoms and tear film stability. A possible reason for the lack of correlation may be due to the fact that subjectivity is difficult to quantify. However, scales like the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) have been established in an attempt to quantify subjective experiences such as visual quality. We will be using the NRS to gauge the comfort of the drop upon the initial application to get a general idea of the comfort the drop provides to the user.

Although there have been several studies done on residence time and visual effect of ophthalmic formulations separately, there is no current research correlating these two aspects of therapeutic efficacy. This study will be the first to concurrently investigate residence time (using FITC-dextran) and visual effect of an ophthalmic formulation.",NO,Dry Eye Disease,,"The principal outcome parameters will be gross residence time in minutes and the effect on contrast sensitivity time in minutes., 1 hour","A secondary outcome variable will be the comfort value (NRS) of the initial drop application., 1 hour",Southern California College of Optometry at Marshall B.

NCT02803879,Assessing the Capability of Cardiogoniometry (CGM) to Detect Changes in Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy Device Settings,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02803879,HF-CGM,COMPLETED,"Some patients with heart failure require treatment called cardiac-resynchronisation therapy (CRT) which involves putting a pacemaker into the heart to make both ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart) contract together, making the pumping of the blood to the rest of the body more efficient.

it is important to get the CRT pacemaker checked to make sure that it is working correctly and performing its job. However, it can be difficult to adjust the settings of the pacemaker just the right amount to ensure the heart is pumping efficiently.

One of the ways this can be done is by using a special machine which uses ultrasound to make a 2-dimensional image of the heart called an echocardiogram. This technique can also be used to measure the flow of blood in the heart and calculate how efficient it is at pumping blood. However adjusting the settings of the pacemaker with this device is difficult to use and time consuming.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) a 2-dimensional electrical tracing of the hearts activity is another tool used to help adjust the settings of pacemakers, to make the heart pump more efficiently. Furthermore, recent research has shown that this is better than echocardiogram at optimising pacemaker device settings.

A new type of ECG called cardiogoniometry (CGM) has recently been developed which creates a 3-dimensional view of the hearts electrical activity and has already been shown to be better than normal ECG at diagnosing certain conditions like angina and heart attacks. However it has never been used to try optimise the settings of the pacemakers used in CRT and may be quicker and easier to use than then other methods available. More importantly it is hoped by doing this it will reduce the symptoms that patients suffer as it is making the heart pump more efficiently.

As it has been untested and never used in this setting before, and there it is necessary to find out if the CGM machine will recognise when the settings on the pacemaker are changed.

The aims of this study is to see if the CGM machine can pick up changes to pacemaker settings, with the hope of running a later study to see if it can be used to optimise settings on the pacemaker used in CRT.",NO,Heart Failure,DEVICE: Cardiogoniometry,"Mean cardiac axis with no pacing, Mean cardiac axis of participants when they are not being paced will be calculated with 95% confidence intervals., Within the first 30 days after end of participant enrollment|Mean cardiac axis with rv pacing, Mean cardiac axis of participants when they are being paced from the RV will be calculated with 95% confidence intervals., Within the first 30 days after end of participant enrollment|Mean cardiac axis with lv pacing, Mean cardiac axis of participants when they are being paced from the LV will be calculated with 95% confidence intervals., Within the first 30 days after end of participant enrollment|Mean cardiac axis with biv pacing, Mean cardiac axis of participants when they are being biventricular paced will be calculated with 95% confidence intervals., Within the first 30 days after end of participant enrollment",,Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,12,OTHER_GOV,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC,2015-08,2016-07,2016-08,2016-06-17,,2019-07-08,"Castle Hill Hospital, Kingston upon Hull, East Yorkshire, HU16 5JQ, United Kingdom",

NCT03672279,Validation of a Novel Self-Administered Cognitive Assessment Tool (CogCheck) in Patients With Mild and Major Neurocognitive Disorder Predominantly Due to Alzheimer's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03672279,CogCheck-MC,RECRUITING,"Due to the demographical development, age-related diseases will drastically increase over the next decades. To face this healthcare challenge, early and accurate identification of cognitive impairment is crucial. The assessment of neurocognitive functioning ideally requires a tool that is short, easy to administer and interpret, and has high diagnostic accuracy. In this context, the use of computerized test batteries is receiving increasing attention. Compared to paper-pencil tests, computerized test batteries have many advantages. The possibility to measure reaction times may provide additional information. Moreover, test questions are always presented the exact same way, examiner-related bias is eliminated, and results are available immediately after examination. Due to the ability to adjust the level of difficulty to the performance of the individual, floor and ceiling effects may be minimized. Additionally, costs are reduced, and fewer materials and less trained personnel are required. Finally, big data approaches and the use of machine learning algorithms are becoming more popular in the field of clinical diagnostics, and computerized cognitive test batteries may facilitate future data collection to this aim.

In 2014, we developed a self-administered tablet computer program for the iPad (CogCheck) to assess preoperative cognitive functioning in surgery patients.

The cognitive tests used in the CogCheck application are identical or similar to the paper-and-pencil tests that are currently used in dementia diagnostics. Replacing some of the paper-and-pencil tests by a computerized test battery may facilitate the routine neuropsychological examinations. Thus, we aim to investigate the diagnostic accuracy and user-friendliness of CogCheck when applied in a cognitively impaired patient sample. In a first step, the diagnostic properties of CogCheck will be examined by differentiating between healthy controls and patients with mild or major neurocognitive disorder (NCD) predominantly due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Data from healthy controls have been collected (EKNZ Req-2016-00393) in a previous normative study of CogCheck. Thus a further aim is to investigate the user-friendliness of CogCheck in patients with mild or major NCD predominantly due to AD.

The primary aim of our study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of CogCheck for patients with mild or major NCD predominantly due to AD in a German-speaking population.

Secondary aims are: (1) to examine the user-friendliness of CogCheck in patients with mild or major NCD predominantly due to AD, (2) to compare the results between cognitively healthy individuals (EKNZ Req-2016-00393) and patients with mild or major NCD predominantly due to AD on each of the CogCheck subtest, (3) to establish an algorithm with the CogCheck subtests that optimally distinguishes between cognitively healthy controls (EKNZ Req-2016-00393) and patients with mild or major NCD predominantly due to AD, (4) to compare the diagnostic properties of CogCheck with the ones of the currently used paper-pencil tests.",NO,Dementia Alzheimers|Mild Cognitive Impairment|Cognition Disorders|Neurocognitive Disorders,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: CogCheck,"CogCheck, Results obtained in each subtest of CogCheck consisting of total scores and times (i.e., total seconds), where relevant for answering., Baseline assessment","Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Baseline assessment|Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Baseline assessment|Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease - Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (CERAD-NAB), Baseline assessment|Basel Verbal Learning Test (BVLT), Baseline assessment|Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Baseline assessment|Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), Baseline assessment|Feedback questionnaire to assess the user-friendliness of CogCheck, Baseline assessment","University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland",,ALL,OLDER_ADULT,,100,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2021-07-27,2024-12-31,2024-12-31,2018-09-14,,2024-03-13,"Memory Clinic, University Department of Geriatric Medicine FELIX PLATTER, Basel, BS, 4055, Switzerland",

For people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), this is caused by problems such as high blood pressure and diabetes. NVAF happens more often in elderly people and can lead to stroke, heart failure, and death. Doctors are currently able to give patients a type of treatment called an anticoagulant. Anticoagulants work by making the blood thinner. They are thought to help reduce the risk of stroke and death caused by NVAF. In this study, researchers wanted to learn more about what elderly people think of taking anticoagulants that do not have any vitamin K in them. These are called non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs).

This study will include up to about 150 Belgian men and women aged 75 years and over who have NVAF and have been treated with NOACs. The study will also include about 10 doctors who have treated these patients.

In this study, there will be no required tests or visits. Instead, patients will answer a paper questionnaire about their use of NOACs. The researchers will ask the doctors questions about how they treat their patients using NOACs. The main types of questions the researchers will focus on are:

* The patient characteristics of the elderly with NVAF who are treated with NOACs
* The level of fear of the elderly about bleeding while using a blood thinner and the fear of stroke/thrombosis.
* The geriatrician's thoughts about using NOACs to treat NVAF in elderly patients
* Those patient characteristics geriatrician's find most important when deciding on the anticoagulation treatment in the elderly patients.

NCT03188679,Development of Potential Biomarkers for Foetal Brain Development After Congenital CMV Infection,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03188679,,UNKNOWN,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common cause of congenital infection, with approximately 0.5% of pregnant women being infected during pregnancy. CMV transmission to the fetus occurs in about one third of women who are infected in first trimester. Babies infected before birth are at risk for serious neurological complications such as intellectual disability, seizures, deafness, and even death. Most couples facing a diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus infection in their unborn baby focus heavily on the predicted neurological outcome for their child. To date, methods to assess brain development in fetuses have been mainly limited to detecting structural brain abnormalities by ultrasound. However, these ultrasound signs may not become apparent until very late in pregnancy, and some neurological disability is not accompanied by any structural brain changes. More research on methods of predicting neurodevelopmental outcome independent of structural brain malformations before third trimester is urgently needed.

The purpose of this study is to investigate a new method of studying the health of unborn babies using amniotic fluid. Amniocentesis is often performed after maternal CMV infection to diagnose fetal infection. Prior research by Dr Hui has demonstrated that cell free RNA in amniotic fluid can provide meaningful information from multiple organs including the fetal brain. The investigators propose to collect and analyse a small sample of amniotic fluid to detect which genes are turned ""on"" or ""off"" (gene expression) in a fetus that has a congenital CMV infection, compared to those without any infection.

The genes that are differentially expressed in CMV infected fetuses will then be analysed to provide information on the broad physiological processes that are altered due to the infection (""functional analysis"") and identify neurodevelopmental gene transcripts of interest for future studies (""biomarker discovery"").",NO,Cytomegalovirus Infections|Neurologic Dysfunction,DEVICE: amniocentesis,"gene expression in amniotic fluid after CMV seroconversion, That fetuses infected with CMV will have an altered gene expression profile compared with noninfected fetuses, as ascertained in amniotic fluid cell-free RNA, 30 months",,Universitaire Ziekenhuizen KU Leuven,University of Melbourne,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,20,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,2017-07,2019-07,2019-12,2017-06-15,,2017-06-15,,

However, many daily aspects such as diet could impair blood pressure control. In addition, many people living under different conditions in different countries are affected by some kind of gum disease. These people experience gingival bleeding, bad breath, teeth mobility and pain. Throughout gum disease development the number of oral germs in the mouth increases including their levels in tongue surface. Oral bacterial are able to convert nitrate widely found in food in nitrite which influences blood pressure. Frequently treatment of gum diseases general combines manual instrumentation with mouthwashes. However, it has been suggested that reduction of oral bacteria by mouthwashes, especially chlorhexidine, is accompanied by decreased conversion of nitrate to nitrite and that this minor nitrite availability would increase blood pressure. Therefore, this is a point to be clarified for patients, physicians and dentists.

NCT02097979,The Impact of a Brief Educational Intervention on Glaucoma Adherence,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02097979,,COMPLETED,"OBJECTIVE Our objective was to determine whether two group educational sessions plus one-on-one eye drop instillation training would improve adherence to glaucoma therapy as measured by pharmacy claims data in a cohort of newly diagnosed patients. Our hypothesis was that adherence would be improved in the intervention group and that patients would better understand their disease and how to manage it.

METHODS Study Design and Population: A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in newly diagnosed glaucoma patients at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital in Montreal, Canada. Half of the participants were randomized to receive the intervention and half were randomized to receive a delayed intervention at the conclusion of the study. Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of glaucoma requiring intraocular pressure lowering eye drop therapy and prescription drug insurance through the Régie de l'Assurance Maladie du Québec (RAMQ) (the Quebec Health Insurance Program) throughout the course of the study. There were three sources of data for this study: a questionnaire, the medical record, and RAMQ prescription drug claims data. Follow-up was for one year.

Recruitment and Randomization: From July, 2007 until December, 2011, a researcher approached eligible patients to determine their interest in participating in the study. Interested participants signed the informed consent form and were randomized. Participants in the intervention group were given an appointment to come back to the Hospital for the group intervention. Participants in the control group were given an appointment to receive the group intervention at the end of the study.

Intervention: Small groups of about 10 people were gathered for two 60-90 minute educational sessions on glaucoma in a classroom at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital. During a break, each patient received one-on-one teaching on how to properly instill drops without touching the eye or using unnecessary drops.

Questionnaire and Assessment of Eye Drop Technique: A single questionnaire was given at the end of the study to all participants. The intervention group completed the questionnaire after the intervention while the control group completed the questionnaire before the intervention. Questions were included on demographics, systemic comorbidities, ocular medications, eye drop practices and difficulties, and glaucoma knowledge.

The instructor rated the ability of the participant to put eye drops in the eye taking into account the number of drops that were used and whether contact with the lid or conjunctiva occurred (good, fair, bad).

We created a composite score on the perception of the importance of glaucoma eye drop therapy using the following four questions: 1) do you think glaucoma is a serious disease, 2) do you believe that your treatment will be effective, 3) do you think your drops can lower the pressure in your eyes, 4) do you think your drops can help to preserve vision. Answers of no or do not know were given 0 points and answers of yes were given 1 point. Scores were summed and the composite score ranged from 0 to 4.

Medical Chart Review: At the end of the follow-up period, information was obtained on: the prescribed eye drop therapy for each patient per eye, whether the patient had undergone glaucoma filtering surgery, whether the patient had died or was no longer being followed, the most recent visual field mean deviation in the better eye using the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer 24-2 SITA Standard Program.

Pharmaceutical Claims and Calculation of Medication Possession Ratio: The Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) was calculated as the sum of days of prescription supply divided by the number of days in which a prescription was required. Each person gave consent to contact the RAMQ to obtain pharmaceutical claims for all glaucoma medications. Data were collected on the date of purchase, and the name, dose, and class of the medicine. Data on the number of days of medication available per bottle were taken from the Rylander and Friedman studies with the minimum value used. For the numerator of the MPR, we calculated how many days of medication were available using RAMQ data. For the denominator of the MPR, we calculated the number of days that medication was prescribed in the medical chart. We took into account whether drops were needed for one or two eyes. If a participant was on multiple medications, we calculated a single mean MPR for all medications. We then dichotomized the MPR so that those having medication less than 75% of the days were defined as non-adherent, as we did previously in Djafari et al.

SIGNIFICANCE Adherence can be a problem in glaucoma because patients must often take daily eye drops despite not noticing any benefit to their vision and despite frequent side effects. Low cost interventions that help to improve adherence are needed.",NO,Glaucoma Medication Adherence,BEHAVIORAL: Glaucoma Educational Intervention,"Medication Possession Ratio, 1-year post enrollment","Eye drop instillation technique, Eye drop instillation technique was measured by direct observation.

However the data are contradicting in respect to the direction of this association and therefore the net effect of UPS activity on the cardiovascular system is not known. Inhibitors of UPS are currently standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Heart failure and hypertension have been reported in studies of carfilzomib, an irreversible 2nd generation proteasome inhibitor, both as a single agent and in combination with other drugs but their potential vascular toxicity is not adequately studied. Furthermore, as the role of the UPS has not been studied yet clinically but only in experimental and autopsy based studies, assessment of UPS inhibition in humans would facilitate understanding of the UPS-mediated pathophysiologic mechanisms in human atherosclerosis. Thus, this project may stimulate further research on the role of UPS in atherogenesis and potential new therapeutic approaches on vascular dysfunction may arise. We designed the following project in order to investigate the acute and chronic effect of Carfilzomib (CFZ) on cardiovascular function. Patients with an indication to receive CFZ will be recruited to be followed in the Clinical Therapeutics Department in pre-specified timepoints. Functional and structural measurements including markers of arterial stiffness and subclinical atherosclerosis will be performed using non-invasive well-validated techniques. Blood pressure will be also evaluated using 24h hour ambulatory monitoring. Evaluation of cardiac function will be performed at baseline and thereafter at 6 months or earlier if a suspicious event occurs necessitating evaluation of cardiac function.

NCT01941979,A Study Comparing Adjuvant Chemotherapy Versus Observation for Patients With Rectal Adenocarcinoma After Neoadjuvant Chemo-Radiotherapy Treatment.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01941979,,UNKNOWN,"Surgery is the most indicated curative treatment for rectal cancer when disease is diagnosed early, however local recurrence risk increases when the disease is diagnosed at advanced stage.T1-2 tumors have a recurrence rate lower than 10%, while T3N0 tumors have 15% - 35% and positive lymph nodes T3-4 45% to 67% of recurrence rate within 5 years. These data indicate that patient who have a high risk of tumor recurrence should receive an adjuvant therapy treatment.

It is possible that adjuvant chemotherapy has a positive impact on survival of patients already treated with neoadjuvant combination therapy. However it is necessary to identify those patients that might have this benefit.

An exploratory analysis of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 22921 study showed that the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy has benefited only the group of patients who had a reduction of tumor stage to ypT0-2. In the group who had no reduction (ypT3-4), there was no benefit. Retrospective analyzes suggest that the response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is a predictor of prognosis and even benefit to adjuvant chemotherapy. However the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with rectal cancer remains controversial. Therefore, a randomized trial is needed to answer this question.

Based on these data the investigators proposed a phase III study, randomized, unblinded, adjuvant chemotherapy based on Fluorouracil(5-FU) and Oxaliplatin versus observation in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma T3-4, N0-1, M0 previously treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and who did not presented complete response. The investigator believes that this subgroup of patients, who have not achieved complete response, will be benefit from adjuvant therapy.

Study objective:

The main objective of this study is verify if adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU and oxaliplatin, for 4 months, increases recurrence-free survival versus the observation. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of toxicity, overall survival and assessment of biomarkers (study protocol separately).

The study's primary endpoint is disease-free survival (DFS) to be defined as time from randomization to radiological detection of distant disease and / or locoregional recurrence.

This research will be observational, meaning patients will not be randomly assigned to different treatment groups. To objectively assess participents; return to everyday, professional, and sports activities, validated questionnaires will be sent to participents in addition to routine clinical practice. The study will be prospective and comparative based on the type of prostheses used.

In order to capture the current practices of surgeons performing THR in participents under 50 years old in France, the study will be conducted at multiple centers across the country. Since hip resurfacing is performed only in certain centers, approximately half of the participating centers are experienced in this technique.

NCT00380679,Offering Influenza and Pneumococcal Vaccine to Patients Being Evaluated in the Emergency Department,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00380679,,UNKNOWN,"According to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), all people aged 50 years or older and persons aged less than 50 years who have medical conditions that put them at increased risk for serious influenza disease should receive an annual influenza vaccination. However, since the mid-1990s, vaccination rates and racial disparities have mostly remained static, and there has been limited progress towards the Healthy People 2010 objectives for influenza vaccination coverage.

The purpose of this study is to determine what proportion of previously unvaccinated persons in target groups for whom influenza and pneumococcal vaccine are recommended will accept and receive influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccine in an urban emergency department (ED), and to estimate the potential impact of ED vaccination on population-based vaccination coverage. The intervention will utilize a combination of assessment survey, vaccine information and pre-printed vaccine order sheets.

The target population for influenza vaccinations includes all patients aged 18 years and older for whom influenza vaccine is recommended by the ACIP. This includes all persons aged 50 years and older and persons aged 18 to 49 years who are in one of the following groups: 1) health care workers, 2) pregnant women, 3) residents of long-term care facilities, 4) household contacts and out-of-home caregivers of children aged 0 to 23 months, or 5) persons with underlying chronic medical conditions which increase their risk of influenza-related complications. The target population for pneumococcal vaccination includes all patients aged 65 years or older who have not previously been vaccinated against pneumococcus or have not received the vaccine within 5 years (and were less than 65 years at the time of vaccination).",NO,High Risk for Serious Influenza|High Risk for Pneumonia,BIOLOGICAL: Influenza vaccination|BIOLOGICAL: Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination,Acceptance of vaccinations|Receipt of vaccination,Reasons vaccines were refused|Reasons vaccines were not administered,Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION,2005-12,,2006-03,2006-09-26,,2006-09-26,"Baton Rouge General Medical Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 70806, United States|Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 70808, United States",

NCT02584179,Biparametric MRI for Detection of Significant Prostate Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02584179,BIDOC,COMPLETED,"Our aim is to develop a new diagnostic approach to improve the diagnosis of men suspicious of having significant prostate cancer (sPCa). The current diagnostic technique (standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies \[TRUS-bx\]) rely on multiple prostate biopsy cores (10-12 samples) and if negative repeated biopsy sessions. This increases both patient complications (severe infections, bleeding and anxiety) and the diagnosis of insignificant cancer causing overtreatment. Still, significant cancers are missed. In addition, worldwide antibiotic-resistant bacteria increase, while effective antibiotics are declining. Thus, a noninvasive diagnostic tool to improve selection of men with clinically suspicion of PCa who need a biopsy from those who can avoid one is strongly needed. Previous studies in our department show that MRI in a selected patient cohort with prior negative TRUS-bx can improve the detection rate of clinically significant PCa and allows for a more accurate assessment of cancer stage and aggressiveness. However, the value of an MRI used as a first-line tool in the diagnostic examination of men in suspicion of PCa is uncertain. Furthermore, a full scale MRI prostate examination recommended by the European Society of Urogenital Radiology includes intravenous contrast-media and multiple sequences. This is both time-consuming and cost full, which reduces its feasibility for more widespread clinical implementation. We believe that a simpler, faster biparametric MRI (bpMRI) using less scan sequences and circumvents intravenous contrast-media and anti-peristaltic drugs would decrease image acquisition time, reduce costs and is sufficient to preserve diagnostic accuracy for sPCa detection in biopsy-naive men. Consequently, we will include biopsy-naive men in a protocol-based research project. The objective is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of bpMRI to rule out sPCa and whether a bpMRI can be used as a diagnostic non-invasive screening tool to 1) improve the diagnosis of sPCa 2) assess cancer aggressiveness 3) increase precision of biopsies and 4) reduce the number of biopsy sessions and cores. We evaluate the clinical significance of the detected cancers and whether bpMRI could be used as a triage test to improve the diagnosis of sPCa and aid in the determination of which men could safely avoid unnecessary biopsies.

This new diagnostic approach has the potential to significantly reduce patient hazards and complications. We aim to reach 1000 included men. We believe that bpMRI used in the clinical decision-making has the potential to change the future management of PCa. However, we still miss the scientific evidence to substantiate its preliminary promising results before this technique can be widely used to benefit all men. This large research project is to the best of our knowledge powered to include the largest patient sample size published within this field.",NO,Prostate Cancer,DEVICE: Biparametric MRI before biopsy,"Diagnostic accuracy of a bp-MRI in detection and ruling out significant PCa in biopsy-naive men, All included men undergo bp-MRI at inclusion followed by diagnostic standard TRUS biopsies (current diagnostic standard).

- Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a functional imaging technique that can be uses light to study brain function while allowing for movement. To look at blood flow in the brain, NIRS uses a low-power light source with detectors that see how the light changes as it passes through brain tissue. Brain blood flow can indicate which parts of the brain are active during different tasks. Researchers want to study children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and will use NIRS to compare the blood flow in the brain of children with ADHD and ASD with that of typically developing children.

Objectives:

* To see how well NIRS can detect changes in brain blood flow during tests of thinking and memory in children.
* To compare blood flow in the brains of typically developing children and those with ADHD or ASD.

Eligibility:

- Children between 4 and 8 years of age with ASD, ADHD, or children with no psychiatric diagnoses.

Design:

* Participants will be screened for eligibility. Those who are taking stimulant medication for ADHD or ASD will need to stop taking it for 3 days before the study visit.
* After participating in a screening assessment, all participants will have one study visit. At this visit, they will have be asked to complete two tasks during a NIRS scan. For both tasks, they will react to images on a computer screen. This visit will last about 2 hours.

Various tests are performed to evaluate the block level after spinal anesthesia, incluyding pinprick test, cold application, and motor examination. These tests are performed to check whether the pain, sympathetic and motor nerve fibers are affected, respectively, after the block; and good communication with the patient is important here. However, it is extremely difficult to evaluate these tests in pediatric, geriatric, mentally retarded or uncooperative patients.

Sympathectomy can be used as a criterion to evaluate the success of the block that occurs after the spinal anesthesia procedure. Sympathetic nerve fibers are the first to be affected by the block, and the success of the block can be evaluated with the revealed sympathectomy. Sympathectomy in the lower extremities after spinal block increases arterial blood flow.

Compliance with the disease and immunosuppressive treatment has an important place in the success of transplants. This study was planned to examine the effect of video-supported education given to liver transplant patients in line with the Health Belief Model on adaptation to chronic disease and medication use.

The research will be conducted as a randomized controlled experimental study. The population of the research will consist of adult patients who received liver transplantation at İnönü University Turgut Özal Medical Center. The sample will consist of 90 patients determined by power analysis. Patients will be divided into three groups: control (n=30), 1st experiment (n=30) and 2nd experiment (n=30). Data will be collected between August 2023 and December 2023 using the Patient Information Form, Chronic Disease Adaptation Scale, Immunosuppressive Drug Use Compliance Scale and Rational Drug Use Scale. Video-supported training will be provided to patients in the experimental group to increase compliance with the disease and immunosuppressive treatment and to ensure rational drug use. Patients in the 1st experimental group will receive video-supported training in line with the Health Belief Model for one month, and patients in the 2nd experimental group will receive video-supported standard training for one month. This video training will be given to the experimental group patients outside the routine nursing care of the clinic. The video-supported training is planned to last 20-30 minutes. Nursing care in the routine practice of the clinic will be applied to the control group. Evaluation of data; It will be done with number, percentage, mean, standard deviation, chi-square, paired t test, t test analysis in independent groups, ANOVA and ANCOVA.

In order for the scale to be applied, patients must complete at least two months after transplantation. The scale consists of 11 items in total. Scoring is done with a 5-point and 2-point Likert type rating. The scale includes positive and negative expressions. Positive statements are 4 and 6, and negative statements are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Positive statements are scored from 1 to 5, while negative statements are scored from 5 to 1. For positive items, 1 point is given for a 'yes' answer and 5 points are given for a 'no' answer. The lowest score of the scale is 11 and the highest score is 55. As the score from the scale increases, compliance with medication use increases, and as the score decreases, compliance with medication use decreases.

NCT00212979,Measuring Kidney Function in Kidney Transplantation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00212979,,COMPLETED,"Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for permanent kidney failure. Following transplantation, the kidney function must be followed closely to detect problems so that investigations and appropriate treatment can be started early. Currently, function is monitored with the use of serum creatinine. In clinical trials involving kidney transplant recipients, markers of kidney function, such as serum creatinine, are increasingly being used as outcomes to evaluate new treatments. However, serum creatinine is not very accurate or sensitive at detecting change in kidney transplant function. Newer methods of evaluating kidney function, such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation and cystatin C, are known to be accurate markers of function in patients with non-transplant kidney disease. This study will compare the MDRD estimate and cystatin C estimate of kidney function with an accepted method (radioisotope clearance study) of measuring true kidney function in 250 renal transplant patients. Each patient will have 2 measurements made at least 3 months apart to determine the accuracy and responsiveness to change over time for the MDRD equation and cystatin C. If the results demonstrate that these new methods are accurate then clinical care and research studies involving transplant patients will be greatly enhanced.

NCT02662179,Are the Fried Criteria Predictive of a Functional Decline in Older People With Solid Malignant Tumors?,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02662179,,COMPLETED,"Identifying the frail elderly patients or those at risk of becoming frail has become a cornerstone of modern geriatric medicine. Many instruments have been developed to identify fragility at the individual level. The 'Fragile' phenotype defined by Fried is based on 5 criteria: weakness, slowness, low level of activity, exhaustion, and unintentional weight loss. The patient is fragile if it meets at least three out of five criteria. It is 'pre-fragile' if it meets one or two criteria.

In onco-geriatrics, the International onco-geriatrics society recommends the implementation of a 'G8 scale' to detect elderly patients at risk of fragility. People with a positive G8 are then referred to the geriatric team to benefit from a comprehensive geriatric assessment. This evaluation is interpreted by the geriatrician, who proposes an action plan to overcome the various problems of the elderly patient. The evaluation can also help the oncologist in the choice of treatment for the patient: palliative care, standard treatment or adapted treatment (No-go, Go-go or slow-go).

The investigators would like to assess if fragility as defined by the Fried criteria is predictive of a functional, physical or cognitive decline, or a loss of quality of life in patients treated for a solid malignant tumor.

Furthermore, they will assess if the frailness categorization has an impact on the oncologic treatment decision.

NCT04712279,The (HD)IVACOV Trial (The High-Dose IVermectin Against COVID-19 Trial),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04712279,,UNKNOWN,"Ivermectin, a classical antiparasitic and anti-scabies agent, has demonstrated antiviral activity for a variety of viruses including chikungunya virus, zyka virus and dengue virus and was tested as a potentially effective for COVID-19.

Although ivermectin demonstrated potent in vitro action by reducing viral load by 5000x after 48 hours of incubation, simultaneous pharmacokinetics simulations suggested that the minimum effective concentrations would be unfeasible to be reached within safety range (EC-50 = 2 Micromol).

However, despite the theoretical unfeasible concentrations to be achieved, preliminary observational yet well-structured studies followed by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrated ivermectin efficacy when combined with hydroxychloroquine, doxycycline or azithromycin, which was corroborated by a recent systematic review and metanalysis. In common, a dose-response effect for effectiveness was observed, and no adverse effects was reported at any dose between 0.2mg/kg/day and 1.0mg/kg/day.

Based on the scientific rationale combined with the preliminary evidence, ivermectin has sufficient evidence to be tested in higher doses in a RCT for COVID-19. The investigators propose to test ivermectin at high doses as a treatment for patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19, aiming to explore the possible protective role of high-dose ivermectin in SARS-CoV-2 infection in terms of reduction of clinic and virologic disease duration, and prevention of oxygen use, hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, death, and post-COVID persisting symptoms.",NO,Covid19,DRUG: Ivermectin 0.6mg/kg/day|DRUG: Ivermectin 1.0mg/kg/day|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Hydroxychloroquine,"World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Progression Scale [0 to 10; 0 = uninfected; 10 = death], Treatment efficacy of high-dose Ivermectin relative to placebo arm as assessed by World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Progression Scale \[0 to 10; 0 = uninfected; 10 = death\], Day 14","World Health Organization (WHO) COVID=19 Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement [1 to 8; 1 = not hospitalized, no limitation on activities; 8 = death] [Time Frame: Day 7], Treatment efficacy of high-dose Ivermectin relative to placebo arm as assessed by World Health Organization (WHO) COVID=19 Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement \[1 to 8; 1 = not hospitalized, no limitation on activities; 8 = death\], Day 7|Time-to-recovery, Recovery is defined as the first day on which the subject satisfies category one from the COVID ordinal scale (defined in Section 5.1): (1) Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities. \[Parameter: Number of days until achieve Category 1 of the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID=19 Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement \[1 to 8; 1 = not hospitalized, no limitation on activities; 8 = death\], Day 28|Viral load, Treatment efficacy of high-dose Ivermectin relative to placebo arm as assessed by viral load measured by rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 (CTs), Day 5|Positivity rate of rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 (qualitative analysis), Treatment efficacy of high-dose Ivermectin relative to placebo arm as assessed by viral load measured by positivity rate (% of positive, detected rtSARS-CoV-2), Day 5|Duration of fatigue, Treatment efficacy of high-dose Ivermectin relative to placebo arm as assessed by duration of fatigue (days), Day 14|Duration of anosmia, Treatment efficacy of high-dose Ivermectin relative to placebo arm as assessed by duration of anosmia (days), Day 14|Overall duration of clinical manifestations, Treatment efficacy of high-dose Ivermectin relative to placebo arm as assessed by duration of overall symptoms (days), Day 14|Proportion of subjects needing additional drugs or interventions, Defined as the number of subjects who have required additional drugs (glucocorticoids, anticoagulants, etc) or interventions allocated to each arm divided by the number of subjects randomized to that specific arm (%).

NCT00363779,Effect of Cyclosporine Therapy on Gene Expression in Patients With Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00363779,,TERMINATED,"Background:

* Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
* LGL is associated with low numbers of white blood cells (leading to recurring infections), red blood cells (causing anemia) and platelets (causing abnormal bleeding).
* Cyclosporine (CSA) is an immunosuppressive drug that improves low blood cell counts in about 50 percent of patients with LGL leukemia.

Objectives:

* To identify what factors determine why cyclosporine works in some patients and not in others.
* To identify what causes low blood counts in LGL leukemia.

Eligibility: Patients 18 years of age and older with LGL leukemia.

Design:

* Patients have a medical history, physical examination blood tests, bone marrow biopsy and x-ray studies, including chest x-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Patients with an easily accessible enlarged lymph node have a node biopsy (removal of a small piece of tissue for microscopic examination).
* Patients take cyclosporine twice a day by mouth. Blood samples are taken at least weekly to adjust the cyclosporine dosing to maintain therapeutic serum levels.

Although patients typically present this disease as newborns and rarely in later infancy, there have been reports of patients presenting with CCHS in adulthood.

The present study reports a unique familial case in which the father (proband) presented late-onset CCHS with an expansion mutation of the Phox2B gene that was confirmed by genetic analysis. Surprisingly, the proband did not report any manifestation of the disease during childhood, and the disease progressed following an insidious course until adulthood. At the time of diagnosis, he did not present signs of pulmonary hypertension and right-side heart failure. The patient responded well to nocturnal invasive ventilation. In contrast, his son presented CCHS as a newborn with the full complement of symptoms while his daughter did not.

The present report shows that CCHS cases characterized by a mutated Phox2 gene can progress without many symptoms and that the treatment approach used here was efficient for controlling the course of the disease. Furthermore, this case indicates that incomplete penetrance can occur.

NCT00154479,The Correlation Between the Haplotype of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) and Human Papillomavirus,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00154479,,UNKNOWN,"Cervical cancer is the most frequent neoplasm of women in Taiwan and in the world. It influences about 2,700 women with about 1,000 women dying of cervical cancer each year and in Taiwan. Human papillomaviruses (HPV) have been consistently implicated in causing cervical cancer especially those high-risk types which have been strongly associated with cervical cancer. In recent years, there has been compelling evidence that infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is a major etiologic factor in the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical carcinoma.

As in most virus-induced diseases, an adequate immune response is likely to play a key role in the clearance of HPV infections and HPV-related lesions. This assumption is born out by both epidemiological studies and animal models. Immune-compromised patients such as HIV-infected women, organ transplant recipients, and patients suffering from other forms of malignancies, are at a higher risk of developing CIN lesions and invasive cervical cancer. Moreover, several studies establish the existence of natural HPV E7-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunity in humans. Only a minority of women infected with oncogenic HPV types develop CIN or cervical cancer. Indeed, the majority of CIN lesions do not progress or even regress to normal cytology, indicating that other factors such as an inadequate immune function are necessary for the development of progressive CIN lesions and cervical carcinoma.

Consequently, the HLA class I and II phenotypes may be correlated with an effective immune response against HPV-associated cervical lesions. Differences in the recognition of foreign antigens, such as those contributed by alleles at the HLA class I or II loci, might be proposed to affect the risk of developing cervical cancer.

In the present proposal, the investigators would like to examine the HLA class I and II associations among Taiwanese women with cervical neoplasia. The purposes of this proposal are:

1. to address the relationships between the HLA class I and II haplotype, HPV infection, and cervical cancer; and
2. to elucidate the immunologic responses to HPV type 16 in different HLA class I and II haplotypes. It will help the investigators to identify which population of HLA genotypes is more susceptible to HPV infection and progresses to invasive cervical cancer. The results of this research will be very useful for the prevention and screening of cervical cancer in the future.",NO,Cancer of Cervix,,,,National Taiwan University Hospital,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,700,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2003-10,,2008-12,2005-09-12,,2006-12-14,"Wen-Fang Cheng, Taipei, Taiwan",
NCT02970279,Reducing Stasis Outcomes for Depression in Group Behavioural Activation Therapy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02970279,,COMPLETED,"Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders and it is estimated up to 50% of patients do not respond to evidenced-based psychotherapy treatment, recording a 'stasis' outcome. However, there is limited research understanding this population, meaning a considerable number of people continue to suffer. The purpose of this study is to 1) identify depression stasis prevalence and predictors in an existing evidenced-based group treatment for depression, 2) run a clinical trial to test whether an embedded intervention based on theoretical and clinical practice evidence can help reduce patient depression stasis and drop-out rates and 3) understand what aspect of therapy produces change (or prevents change in stasis). The study will be based on behavioural activation (BA) therapy delivered in an eight-session group format in an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service in the United Kingdom. BA is one of the most effective psychotherapies available for depression and focuses on helping patients to increase their engagement with valued activities to help break out of the cycle of depression. Firstly, an archived anonymised dataset of routine depression measures from patients who have previously received the existing group BA treatment will be analysed. Secondly, the group BA treatment delivered to patients in 2017 will be enhanced with two treatment augmentations. One augmentation will target stasis outcomes through the addition of specific 'if-then' planning (known as implementation intentions) when setting between-session homework and the other augmentation will target patient drop-out by informing patients about group BA effectiveness and therapy-dose evidence. The stasis outcomes and drop-out rates from the enhanced treatment in the trial will be compared with the archived outcomes to see if the intervention has had an effect and the role of engaging in valued living as a mechanism of change for depression symptoms will be examined. It is hypothesised that a) 50% of patients who have received the existing BA group treatment for depression will have a stasis outcome, b) there will be a significant reduction in depression stasis outcomes and drop-out rate following the enhanced BA group treatment delivered in the trial and c) engagement in valued living will have a mediating effect on outcome for responding patients following the enhanced BA group treatment but the effect will not be present for patients with a stasis outcome.",NO,Depression,BEHAVIORAL: Behavioural Activation Group (BAG) Psychotherapy,"Change in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scores, Validated 9-item self-report measure of depressive symptoms, Week 1 (pre-treatment), at every weekly treatment session attended (for 8 weeks) and at week 8 (end of treatment)","Patient attendance at treatment sessions, Number of therapy sessions patients attend in a course of treatment, Weeks 1-8 (every weekly treatment session - maximum of 8)|Change in Valued Living Questionnaire (VLQ) score, Validated self-report measure of engagement in valued living, Week 1 (pre-treatment), week 4 (at the 4th treatment session) and at week 8 (end of treatment)|Change in Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) score, Validated 7-item self-report measure of anxiety symptoms, Week 1 (pre-treatment), at every weekly treatment session attended (for 8 weeks) and at week 8 (end of treatment)|Change in Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) score, Validated self-report measure of functional impairment as a result of mental health problems, Week 1 (pre-treatment), at every weekly treatment session attended (for 8 weeks) and at week 8 (end of treatment)",University of Sheffield,Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust|Howard Morton Trust,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,34,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2016-12,2017-12,2017-12,2016-11-21,,2018-05-04,"Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust - Improving Access to Psychological Therapies Service, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, S3 7ND, United Kingdom",

The study will focus on evaluating its impact on reducing symptoms related to Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PACS) in adults aged 50 years and older.

The main research questions this study aims to answer are:

1. Does adhering to a healthy US-style diet, which is abundant in anti-inflammatory properties, effectively mitigate fatigue symptoms in adults with PACS?
2. Does adhering to a healthy US-style diet, which is abundant in anti-inflammatory properties, effectively mitigate declines in muscle function and physical performance in adults with PACS?

At the beginning of the study, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either the Dietary Intervention Group, where they will receive personalized dietary plans and weekly sessions, or the Attention Control Group, where they will attend general health sessions on a weekly basis as well.

This research intends to shed light on the potential benefits of the Whole-Diet Approach and its role in ameliorating PACS-related symptoms among older adults.

Stroke represents the leading cause of long-term disability. The specificity of stroke is the sequelae polymorphism that can occurs: physical disability, cognitive deficit and sensitive trouble. Then this large extend of sequelae may have a different impact on daily life. Therefore, we have to consider the individual's own resources and in his whole environment to face the situation. We suppose that each situation, each post-stroke disability will have a different social impact in stroke survivors and their caregivers. Nowadays, Barthel Index and Rankin scale are the standards for the assessment of the stroke impact on survivors' daily life. However, what is the real impact of an activity limitation in daily life? How consider the psychosocial impact of stroke only with functional indicators? For this study we will consider handicap and disability in a societal way. In fact, the WHO developed in 2001 the International Classification of functioning, disability and health that allows to bring the concept of participation restriction, this is to say the consequences of a disability in the real life. The ICF allows to bring a conceptual framework of participation restriction.

Psychosocial consequences of stroke are relatively unknown especially in France. According to our hypothesis, patients with major disabilities and their caregivers will experience more psychosocial consequences and participation restriction in terms of emotional health, quality of life and burden. Also, we hypothesize that stroke severity, the typology of disabilities (motor, cognitive and sensorial) will have a different impact on patients and proxys' lifes in terms of psychosocial consequences, participation restriction and quality of life.

Primary goal: To generate information on the efficacy of DLE as an aid in symptomatic treatment, by reducing the signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19).

Secondary goals:

1. To evaluate clinical deterioration and respiratory alarm data.
2. To evaluate the duration of the clinical picture.
3. To explore cytokine changes associated with the therapeutic effect induced by DLE.
4. To obtain data on the safety of DLE as an aid in the symptomatic treatment of acute respiratory infection (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19).
5. To generate information to validate the contingency scale to assess the severity of acute respiratory disease (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19).

Justification The systemic inflammatory response has been recognized as being responsible for COVID-19 complications. Immunomodulation strategies to control it are currently being considered, including the use of systemic steroids to down-regulate the systemic inflammatory response, the use of human immunoglobulin and even chloroquine given its anti-inflammatory and antiviral qualities; however, none of these treatments has been sufficiently studied or has shown any significant change in the clinical course of infected patients.

Due to the importance of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the absence of specific treatment, it is important to implement new treatments that allow modulating the immune response, and one strategy may be the addition of DLE to symptomatic and supportive treatment.

Hypotheses by goals.

1. The addition of DLE to the symptomatic treatment could decrease the severity of the clinical outcome (signs and symptoms) in individuals with an acute respiratory infection (cases suspected/confirmed by COVID-19).
2. The addition of DLE to the symptomatic treatment could decrease the clinical deterioration due to the acute respiratory infectious process (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19).

The investigators hypothesis is that adding Diacutaneous Fibrolysis to a protocolized physiotherapeutic treatment can provide better outcomes. The investigators objective was to assess the effect of Diacutaneous Fibrolysis on pain, mobility and functional status in patients suffering from SIS.

A double-blind (patient and evaluator) randomized clinical trial was carried out in two public centres of Primary Health Care of the Spanish National Health System. The study protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee from the Jordi Gol Institute of Research in Primary Health Care and all the patients provided written consent.

A hundred and twenty patients with clinical diagnosis of SIS were included and randomly allocated to one of three groups. All groups received the same daily protocolized treatment based on therapeutic exercises, analgesic electrotherapy and cryotherapy during three weeks. Additionally, intervention group received six sessions (two a week) of actual Diacutaneous Fibrolysis; placebo group received six sessions (two a week) of placebo Diacutaneous Fibrolysis, while control group received only the protocolized treatment.

ICH is a dynamic process with three phases: initial hemorrhage, followed by hematoma expansion and perihematoma edema formation. Hematoma volume is correlated with disease progression and outcome. Contemporary evidence proposes that elevated blood pressure is associated with hematoma expansion while more than 90% of patients with ICH present with acute hypertension.

People with hereditary gastric cancer syndrome are at increased risk of getting cancer in their stomach. These people should have regular endoscopies and biopsies to check for cancer if they are choosing to keep their stomach. Researchers want to see if they can improve the detection of cancer by endoscopy. Improved endoscopies could better detect early signs of cancer in people with this syndrome.

Objective:

To see if a small microscope attached to an endoscope to inspect the stomach lining is better than regular endoscopy to find the first signs of cancer in the stomach.

Eligibility:

People ages 18 and older who have a personal or family history of a hereditary gastric cancer syndrome or have a mutation that is known to lead to gastric cancer

Design:

Participants will be screened over the phone or in person with:

* Personal and family medical history
* Review of their medical records

Participants will have a physical exam. Then they will be put under general anesthesia. They will have an endoscopy. A lighted tube will be inserted into the mouth and go down to the stomach. First, the standard device will be used. Then participants will be injected with fluorescein. This is a contrast agent. Then the microscope will be added to the tube and the endoscopic evaluation of the stomach will be repeated. During the procedure, biopsies will be taken from different areas of the stomach. Participants will be observed for a few hours after the procedure.

Many of these conditions arise from musculoskeletal disorders, which may be caused by myofascial dysfunctions. Instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) may be an important therapeutic tool as a means of treatment under these conditions. PURPOSE: To verify the effect of instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) on pain, disability and range of motion (ROM) in individuals with non-specific chronic neck pain. DESIGN: Randomized Clinical Trial. METHODS: The sample will consist of 46 volunteers with non-specific chronic neck pain of both sexes, aged between 18 and 60 years, who presented pain for at least 12 weeks, without irradiation to the upper limbs distally to the shoulders. Of these, those that are not excluded, will be allocated randomly in one of the two groups present: Experimental Group (GE) - IASTM in the neck and Control Group (CG) - Manual myofascial release in the neck region. A blinded evaluator will be assigned to conduct the evaluation process for both groups.

NCT00801879,Mupirocin Ointment to Eliminate Nasal Carriage of Staphylococcus Aureus in HIV Infection,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00801879,,COMPLETED,"Staphylococcus aureus is a bacteria that causes serious, often life threatening infections including pneumonia, wound, and bloodstream infections. Persons with AIDS are at high risk for S. aureus infections. They are also at high risk for nasal carriage of S. aureus. In fact, nasal carriage is a known risk factor for subsequent S. aureus infection. Topical mupirocin, an antibiotic when applied to the anterior nares, is a safe, effective way to eliminate S. aureus colonization. Some studies have shown that mupirocin can also decrease the risk of S. aureus infection, but many of those studies utilized historical controls and none were rigorously tested among AIDS patients over an extended period of time.

The main purpose of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled study is to determine if mupirocin can eliminate S. aureus nasal colonization in residents at PSI (inpatient, drug rehabilitation facility for AIDS patients in the Bronx.) PSI residents currently have a high incidence of S. aureus nasal colonization and infection. Nasal cultures followed by twice daily application of mupirocin vs. placebo for five days will be performed on a monthly basis for 8 months. the study will examine whether mupirocin decreases the incidence of S. aureus infections and prevents S. aureus nasal colonization.

NCT03851679,Pulmonary Echography and BNP Value Pre- and Post- Elective Cesarean Section in Spinal Anesthesia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03851679,,COMPLETED,"Pregnancy is characterized by many biohumoral changes: circulation, respiratory mechanics, oncotic pressure, vascular permeability and many other systems are affected.

Vascular permeability is controlled by endothelial glycocalyx. Several factors such as sepsis, ischemia / reperfusion, inflammatory mediators, trauma, surgery including the Cesarean Section and fluid overload can increase vascular permeability due to a glycocalyx damage.

During Cesarean Section under subarachnoid anesthesia, hypotension may occur. It is a common side effect caused by reduced preload due to aortocaval compression by the uterus. Furthermore, subarachnoid anesthesia causes block of the sympathetic preganglionic fibers which is associated with vasodilation. These changes often require the use of vasopressors and fluids.

A fluid overload associated with the physiological and pathological factors discussed earlier might cause an increased risk of pulmonary edema and acute respiratory failure (IRA) in women undergoing cesarean section under arachnoid anesthesia.

IRA occurs in less than 0.2% of total pregnancies but it is one of the most common cause of admission to intensive care unit in pregnant women.

Among the causes that can lead to IRA in the last trimester of pregnancy we find pneumopathies such as asthma, pulmonary embolism due to amniotic fluid and pulmonary edema related to severe preeclampsia.

Diagnosis of pulmonary edema can be clinical or sub-clinical through laboratory tests such as BNP (b-type natriuretic peptide). It might also be necessary to execute instrumental examinations such as chest radiography (contraindicated in pregnancy) or trans-thoracic ultrasound.

NCT02416479,SystemCHANGE: An Intervention for Medication Change in Adult Kidney Transplant Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02416479,MAGIC,UNKNOWN,"With kidney transplant (KT) recipients as our exemplar population, our goal is to develop and test interventions that increase medication adherence (MA) in chronically ill adults. Among adult KT recipients, non-adherence to immunosuppressive medications (MNA) is the leading predictor of poor outcomes, including rejection, kidney loss, and death. An alarming one-third of KT patients experience MNA even though the problem is preventable. Adherence intervention studies have proven marginally effective for those with acute and chronic illnesses and ineffective for adult KT recipients. Using a randomized controlled trial design with an attention-control group, this R01 will test an innovative 6-month SystemCHANGE intervention to enhance immunosuppressive MA in adult non-adherent KT recipients. This intervention shows great promise for increasing MA with a large effect size of 1.4 in our pilot study. Grounded in the socio-ecological model, SystemCHANGE seeks to systematically improve MA behaviors by identifying and shaping routines, involving supportive others in routines, and using medication taking feedback through small patient-lead experiments to change and maintain behavior. The Medication Event Monitoring System cap, which contains microelectronics that record the date and time of the cap removal, will be used to measure MA. Persistence of the MA behavior change will be examined by evaluating the difference in MA between the two groups during the 6-month maintenance phase. Mediators and moderators of MA will be examined.

It is a pre-malignant condition and may progress to low grade dysplasia, high grade dysplasia and ultimately esophageal adenocarcinoma which has poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of only 5-20%.Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a standard modality and well-studied endoscopic treatment for dysplastic BE. While the rate of complete eradication of dysplasia has been reported to be between 78% - 94% with RFA, the rate of complications associated with this procedure has been reported to be as high as 19.1%, and the costs are high. In a randomized clinical trial in patients with BE and low-grade dysplasia by Phoa et al in 2014, 68 patients underwent radiofrequency ablation therapy with a median of three ablation sessions per patient while 68 patients were randomized to endoscopic surveillance. In this study, a total of 13 patients (19.1%) experienced an adverse event in the treatment group versus no adverse events in the control group. Eight patients (11.8%) developed esophageal strictures which required a median of one dilation, three patients were noted to have small mucosal lacerations, one patient developed retrosternal pain treated with analgesics while one patient developed abdominal pain requiring hospitalization and treatment with analgesia.

NCT06117579,Effect of Inspiratory Muscle Training in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06117579,NOCTURNE,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome is a sleep-related respiratory disorder characterized by partial or total interruptions in breathing during sleep. The majority of syndromes involve an obstructive mechanism (OSA), caused by a reduction in the caliber of the upper airway (UA), most often associated with hypotonia of the surrounding muscles, preventing air from entering the UA during inspiration (1). The clinical consequences of this syndrome are excessive fatigue and daytime sleepiness, which have a negative impact on the quality of life of patients. (2,3) Despite the positive results on apnea-hypopnea index and daytime sleepiness of continuous positive airway pressure (today's reference treatment), its 3-year compliance rate (i.e 59.9% according to a study by Abdelghani et al (4) points to the need to develop other associated therapies.

Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of physiotherapy, such as physical activity and oro-pharyngeal muscle strengthening, notably on the apnea-hypopnea index and daytime sleepiness measured by the Epworth scale (5,6).

Few studies have investigated the effect of inspiratory muscle training (IMT), even though the use of the inspiratory musculature (i.e. the diaphragm) is a means of supplementing the peri-pharyngeal muscles, as it helps to maintain the permeability of the upper airways (7-9). Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) could therefore be considered as part of the physiotherapeutic management of the OSA. The heterogeneity of current results concerning IMT in OSA , but above all the lack of evidence that it is dangerous, means that new clinical studies could be carried out in an attempt to demonstrate its efficacy.

NCT05695079,Efficacy of Electric Fans for Mitigating Thermal Strain in Older Adults During Heat Waves,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05695079,,COMPLETED,"With the increasing regularity and intensity of hot weather and heat waves, there is an urgent need to develop heat-alleviation strategies able to provide targeted protection for heat-vulnerable older adults. While air-conditioning provides the most effective protection from extreme heat, it is inaccessible for many individuals. Air-conditioning is also energy intensive, which can strain the electrical grid and, depending on the source of electricity generation, contribute to increasing green house gas emissions. For these reasons, recent guidance has advocated the use of electric fans as a simple and sustainable alternative to air-conditioning. To date, however, only one study has assessed the efficacy of fan use in older adults and demonstrated that fans accelerate increases in body temperature and heart rate in a short-duration (\~2 hours) resting exposure to 42°C with increasing ambient humidity from 30-70%. While subsequent modelling has suggested that fans can improve heat loss via sweat evaporation in healthy older adults at air temperatures up to 38°C, there is currently no empirical data to support these claims. Further, that work assumed older adults were seated in front of a pedestal fan generating an airflow of 3·5-4·5 m/s at the front of the body. This airflow cannot be attained by most marketed pedestal fans. Studies are therefore needed to evaluate the efficacy of fans for preventing hyperthermia and the associated physiological burden in older adults in air temperatures below 38°C and determine whether the cooling effect of fans, if any, is evident at lower rates of airflow.

To address these knowledge gaps, this randomized crossover trial will evaluate body core temperature, cardiovascular strain, dehydration, and thermal comfort in adults aged 65-85 years exposed for 8 hours to conditions experienced during hot weather and heat waves in North America simulated using a climate chamber (36°C, 45% relative humidity). Each participant will complete three randomized exposures that will differ only in the airflow generated at the front of the body via an electric pedestal fan: no airflow (control), low airflow (\~2 m/s), and high airflow (\~4 m/s). While participants will spend most of the 8-hour exposure seated in front of the fan, they will also complete 4 x 10 min periods of 'activities of daily living' (\~2-2.5 METS, light stepping) at \~2 hour intervals to more accurately reflect activity patterns in the home.",NO,Hyperthermia|Weather; Heat|Heat Stress|Aging,OTHER: No cooling (control)|OTHER: Electric fan (low airflow)|OTHER: Electric fan (high airflow),"Core temperature (peak), Peak rectal temperature (15 min average) during exposure.

Metered dose inhaler (MDI) is the most common method of treatment. Studies show that up to 80% of patients demonstrate incorrect use of MDIs, which results in suboptimal medication delivery to the lungs.

Asthma control can be followed by symptoms, rescue medication usage and measures of airflow obstruction. Current options to monitor control include an asthma diary (relies on consistent use by the patient), pharmacy records of medication dispensing (dispensing does not equal usage), and peak expiratory flow (PEF) meters (significant variability in technique leading to inconsistent results).

NCT02915679,Pain Perception in Suicidal Behavior Vulnerability,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02915679,DOCS,TERMINATED,"In France, almost 1 death on 50 is a suicide. The suicide occurs in unbearable psychic pain where mental trouble has a major influence. It is classified as preventable mortality. According to interpersonal psychological theory of suicide, the repeated exposition to stressful and painful events (as physical abuse) would facilitate suicide attempt through the increased pain tolerance. The social pain (or psychical pain on the broader sense) and physical pain are closely linked.

The investigators hypothesize that the measure of painful perception will be significantly superior on suicidals attempters compared to non-attempters. It will be the case for recent suicide attempters and former suicide attempters, suggesting a suicidal vulnerability trait. Moreover, the investigators expect that social distress induced by a social exclusion paradigm will be significantly superior on suicide attempters compared to non-attempters.

The aim of the study is to investigate the physical and psychic pain on depressed subjects with or without history of suicide attempts.

NCT04937179,The Effect of Ischemic Conditioning on Strength and Ambulation in Subjects With PAD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04937179,,RECRUITING,"Lower limb amputation is common in the United States, with approximately 150,000 amputations annually. Most individuals walking with a prosthesis demonstrate asymmetrical loading-i.e., they favor the amputated side by placing more weight and increased ground reaction forces through the intact limb-which likely contributes to increased metabolic cost of walking. Lack of adequate muscular strength in the lower limb to attenuate these forces places increased stress on the joints, which may be displaced proximally, and may play a role in reported knee and hip pain in the intact limb.

Lower limb muscle weakness following amputation has been well documented. Increasing quadriceps strength is important after an amputation because it is positively correlated with gait speed. Gait speed may also be associated with successful community mobility, which leads to improved quality of life following amputation. Individuals with amputation who resume an active lifestyle are able to maintain strength. However, these individuals represent a minority of persons with lower limb amputation; most individuals report more barriers than motivators to adopt an active lifestyle.

Ischemic conditioning (IC) may strengthen leg muscles and reduce the metabolic cost of activity after amputation. In IC, the limb is exposed to brief, repeated bouts of ischemia (reduced blood flow) immediately followed by reperfusion. IC has been shown to improve muscle performance in healthy and diseased populations. IC has also been used more recently in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) as an intervention to improve function, such as walking ability. Acute exposure to IC increases muscle strength and activation, both in healthy, active individuals and in those with severe neuromuscular dysfunction, such as stroke survivors. IC also attenuates muscular fatigue. Increased fatigue resistance at submaximal contraction levels following IC may be due to increased neural activation of skeletal muscle. Changes in neural activation of muscle may be particularly beneficial during cortical reorganization after amputation. Reduced quadriceps fatigue during submaximal activities may also drive changes in gait kinematics, such as increased knee flexion during loading and mid-stance. Exposure to IC may also increase the oxidative properties of skeletal muscle, offering a direct pathway to reduce metabolic cost. Therefore, IC may lead to cellular changes that lower the metabolic cost of activity.

The primary aim of this study is to quantify the benefits of acute and chronic IC on quadriceps strength and walking economy in individuals with PAD and history of lower limb amputation.",NO,Peripheral Arterial Disease|Peripheral Vascular Disease|Amputation|Lower Limb Amputation Knee|Lower Limb Amputation Above Knee (Injury)|Lower Limb Amputation Below Knee (Injury),PROCEDURE: Ischemic Conditioning Low - Sham Comparator|PROCEDURE: Ischemic Conditioning High - Active Comparator,"Change in quadriceps strength, Quadriceps strength assessed by a Biodex dynamometer, through study completion, an average of 6 weeks|Change in gait kinematics, Gait mechanics assessed by joint angles using Vicon cameras and reflective markers, through study completion, an average of 6 weeks|Change in gait kinetics, Gait mechanics assessed by joint forces using a Bertec instrumented treadmill in combination with gait kinematics, through study completion, an average of 6 weeks|Change in gait metabolics, Assessment of oxygen consumption during walking using a metabolic cart, through study completion, an average of 6 weeks","Six-minute walk test, Measurement of distance walked in six minutes, through study completion, an average of 6 weeks",University of Illinois at Chicago,American Heart Association,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,80,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,2022-07-01,2024-11-01,2024-12-31,2021-06-23,,2024-05-07,"UIC Physical Therapy Faculty Practice, Chicago, Illinois, 60608, United States",

NCT05735379,Impact in Older Adults of Reducing Anticholinergic and Sedative Rx Burden on Physical Function Measured by Wearables,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05735379,,RECRUITING,"Medications with sedative or anticholinergic effects such as antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or opioids have been associated with impaired cognitive and physical function. They are referred to as potentially inappropriate medications or medications that are best avoided by older adults. The accumulated evidence has now shifted the clinical and research focus to evaluating the who, what, and how of the best way to deprescribe (i.e., dose reduction or cessation of these medications). The Drug Burden Index (DBI) allows researchers and clinicians to quantify the cumulative burden of anticholinergic and sedative medications in each patient. Deprescribing these medications is a complex health intervention based on trade-offs between their clinical benefits (e.g., symptom management and prevention of diseases) and their adverse drug events to improve physical and cognitive function. Existing physical function performance metrics, such as gait speed captured in the clinic, are often non-specific and do not reflect real-life performance. Innovative mobility metrics are required to better understand specific deficits with age and disease and the effects of medications on these deficits.

The goal of this project is to better characterize the impact of reducing the anticholinergic and sedative medication burden on physical function in older adults by novel mobility metrics in lab and real-life environments.

A prospective, longitudinal cohort of 182 community-dwelling older adults (≥ 65 years) with a DBI of ≥ 1 will be completed. Using a quasi-experimental design, recruited patients will undergo a medication deprescribing plan, as part of usual clinical care, that includes three gradual changes to their medication regimen resulting in three DBI levels. At each DBI level, physical function mobility including dual-task tests) will be assessed in the lab with wearable sensors during validated clinical tests such as the Short Physical Performance Battery.

Some people have allergic reactions to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Researchers want to learn more about these reactions to provide guidance on who can safely receive the vaccines, including a second dose in people who had a reaction to the first.

Objective:

To study the safety of giving a second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose to people who had a systemic allergic reaction to their first dose.

Eligibility:

People aged 16-69 who had a systemic allergic reaction to their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

Design:

Individuals who have underlying health issues may need to come to the NIH for screening tests to make sure they are safe to receive the vaccine. People who are eligible to participate in the study will be admitted to the NIH hospital and stay for at least 4 days. They will give urine samples. They will have a nasal swab SARS-CoV-2 test. They will have an intravenous line placed in each arm. They will get the study vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine) and one dose of placebo on different days. They will have breathing tests. They may have clinical photography if they develop a rash.

Participants will have 4 follow-up visits - 2 by phone and 2 in-person visits at the NIH campus . They will have allergy skin testing at one visit. Drops of different allergens or controls will be placed on their back or arm. The skin under each drop will be scratched with a tool. If the results are negative, a small amount of allergen will be injected just below the surface of their skin.

Specific objectives To compare changes in the immunophenotype and ex-vivo T-cell functional tests from samples of peripheral blood and measurement in the urine of messenger RNA for FoxP3,in kidney transplant recipients given or not syngeneic (from the recipient) MSC infusion under basiliximab/low-dose RATG induction therapy and maintenance immunosuppressive treatment with low-dose cyclosporine (CsA) plus low-dose mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).

This will assess at different time up to 12 months post transplant. In addition the safety profile of MSC infusion will be investigated. We have planned to start with the safety and biological/mechanistic study in 6 living-related kidney transplant recipients. Three patients will receive ex-vivo expanded syngeneic MSC infusion (2x106 MSCs per kilogram body weight) at the time of kidney transplant, and 3 additional patients no cells (controls), both under the cover of induction therapy with basiliximab and low-dose RATG, and maintenance immunosuppression with low-dose CsA and MMF. Randomization to MSC or no cell infusion will be performed at the time the recipient will sign the informed consent to participate to the study.

Currently, the most promising remedy for preventing and treating sarcopenia is physical activity, particularly progressive resistance training. Yet, the amount of resistance exercise needed to achieve optimal benefits remains largely unknown. This lack of knowledge is underpinned by the notion that aging reduces the ability to adapt to (and benefit from) resistance training, and is further complicated by a relative large degrees of between-subject heterogeneity. The primary aim of the study is to compare the effects of 10 weeks of resistance training with low- and moderate volume (one vs. three sets per exercise) on muscle mass accretion in lower and upper body extremities in young (\<30 years of age) and elderly individuals (\>70 years of age).

To mitigate the increase in dementia, it is crucial to prevent cognitive decline in at risk groups, such as older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Recent research has demonstrated that combining physical (PA) and cognitive activities yields positive effects on the cognitive health of older adults. However, it is essential to explore effective ways of implementing this approach for MCI patients as it may help prevent dementia. An intergenerational program offers a novel and innovative method to achieve this goal by involving both older and younger generations in a single (exercise) program aimed at promoting the health behavior of both groups. Engaging children in an intergenerational, cognitively enriched exercise program for MCI patients primarily benefits the older adults while also providing advantages for the adult children. Therefore, this intergenerational project serves as a valuable and motivating force to enhance the physical, cognitive, and psychosocial health of MCI patients, with a secondary aim of positively impacting the adult children.

Phase 1 of this project (=current study) involves developing the intergenerational, cognitively enriched exercise program. This will be accomplished using a theoretical framework in combination with a co-creation approach, which actively involves MCI patients in the intervention development. Ten thinkaloud interviews (lasting approximately 2 hours) will be conducted with MCI patients and one of their adult children. The insights gained from these interviews will be used to adapt an existing exercise intervention for MCI patients according to their specific needs.

NCT05558579,Use of Postop Sling After Biceps Tenodesis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05558579,,WITHDRAWN,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the use of a sling after surgery (biceps tenodesis) is required in recovery and rehabilitation. Biceps tenodesis is one of the most common surgeries for patients who have biceps tendon inflammation and/or instability, rotator cuff tears, and labral tears that do not get better with medications or physical therapy. A biceps tenodesis involves cutting the biceps tendon and reconnecting it to the shoulder with sutures or metal screws. After surgery, most patients are required to wear a shoulder sling and limit certain arm motions to protect the healing tendon. A recent study found using a more flexible rehabilitation protocol for biceps tenodesis did not change outcomes (strength or range-of-motion) and allows patients to return to some regular activities earlier. This data suggests patients may not need to wear a sling after surgery. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate this.

This study will have two groups-one that continues to wear the sling, and one that does not. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of these groups. At each follow-up visit after surgery, shoulder strength and range-of-motion will be measured and several surveys about shoulder function will be completed. These surveys will provide information to compare between both groups. If assigned to the group that wears the sling, patients will record how often they are wearing the sling in a paper diary/log. Additionally, at the 6-month follow-up, an ultrasound will be obtained to make sure the tendon is healing properly regardless of which group patients are assigned to.

NCT00007579,To Explore Racial Differences in Potential Risk Factors for Developing Prostate Cancer in the VA Population.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00007579,,COMPLETED,"Primary Objectives: To explore racial differences in potential risk factors for developing prostate cancer in the VA population and to compare and contrast the results of this study with that of an ongoing NCI-funded study in North Carolina.

Secondary Objectives: To investigate familial aggregation of prostate cancer in blacks and whites. To determine whether screening behavior differs in men diagnosed with early stage prostate cancer versus those with later stage disease as well as to determine if screening behavior differences exist between blacks and whites.

Primary Outcomes: The primary outcomes are pesticide, occupational and chemical exposure, and dietary history. Other major endpoints include: 1) familial aggregation of prostate cancer; 2) weight, weight history, and weight cycling; 3) subject's knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors about prostate cancer; and 4) treatment choices.

Intervention: N/A

Study Abstract: Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in American men. Among African Americans the incidence and mortality from prostate cancer is even greater. Although incidence rates in the Southern United States tend to be only slightly higher than that of the nation, a clear discrepancy exists between national mortality rates and those in the Southeastern United States. Notably high rates, particularly among African Americans are observed and in North Carolina the prostate cancer mortality rate among African Americans is the highest of any state in the nation. In spite of these statistics, very little is known about racially based differences in the etiology of this disease.

This study hypothesizes that racial differences in the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer may be a result of multiple factors including those that are socioeconomic, environmental, dietary and genetic. This research will provide insight into gene-environmental interactions that initiate and promote prostatic neoplasia as well as address whether there are differences in patterns of care which impact morbidity and survival. The results of this study will also be compared to findings in non-veterans that are being generated through an NCI-funded sister study of these issues under the direction of co-investigator, Dr. JoEllen Schildkraut of Duke University.

However, many patients are refractory to this treatment and suffer from chronic pain over years, leading to a worsening of the quality of live. The mobilization of these patients is one main goal in the therapy of these chronic and inflammatory diseases. Low dose radiation therapy (LDRT) is applied since more than one century for the local treatment of chronic degenerating joint diseases. The success of the treatment was described by many retrospective as well as pattern of care studies, respectively.

Local (only at the painful joint) low dose irradiation of the chronic patients results in most patients in a significantly reduced pain, not only direct after the therapy, but also lasting for more than 12 month in many cases. The patients experience enhanced mobility and increased quality of life. The molecular and cellular processes leading to the pain reduction are just fragmentarily analyzed. Our group revealed that macrophages are key players in radiation-induced immune modulation. Inflammatory macrophages exposed to low doses of radiation showed a reduced inflammatory capacity and attenuated an inflammatory microenvironment. Besides macrophages further immune cells are most likely involved in reduction of inflammation following LD-RT, as in vitro already shown for neutrophils.

The IMMO-LDRT01 study aims for the first time to analyze in detail the immune status of patients suffering from inflammatory, chronic joint diseases before, during and after LD-RT in a longitudinal manner. The multi-color flow cytometry-based assay will allow determining over 30 immune cell subsets and additionally their activation status. Further, biodosimetry will be performed with the whole-blood samples to get hints about dose that the immune cells are exposed to. This will be performed with national and international co-operation partners.

NCT02330679,Prediction of Antidepressant Treatment Response Using Machine Learning Classification Analysis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02330679,,UNKNOWN,"Despite significant advances in pharmacological treatment, the global burden of depression is increasing worldwide. The major challenge in antidepressant treatment is the clinicians' inability to predict the variability in individual response to the treatment. The development of biomarkers to predict treatment outcomes would enable clinician to find the right medication for a particular patient at the early stage of the treatment and thus could reduce prolonged suffering and ineffective protracted treatment. Brain imaging studies that examined brain predictors of treatment response based on group comparisons have limited value in classifying individuals as responders or non-responders. Machine learning classification techniques such as the support vector machine (SVM) method have proven useful in the classification of individual brain image observations into distinct groups or classes. However, studies that have applied the SVM method to structural and functional magnetic resonance scans (fMRI) involved small sample sizes and were confounded by placebo responses. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis of clinical trials and EEG studies have shown that early clinical responses and brain changes at the early phase of antidepressant treatment may predict later clinical outcomes suggesting that neural markers measured in the early phase of antidepressant treatment may improve predictive accuracy. However, there is no fMRI study to date that has examined the predictive accuracy of data obtained in early phase of the treatment. We have preliminary fMRI data relating to early treatment response that form the basis of this proposed study.

- Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men. A chemical called a radiotracer helps doctors get images of this type of cancer. Researchers want to test a radiotracer called N-\[N-\[(S)-1,3-dicarboxypropyl\]carbamoyl\]-4-(18)F-fluorobenzyl-L-cysteine ((18)F-DCFBC) (18F-DCFBC).

Objective:

- To see if the radiotracer 18F-DCFBC can identify sites of prostate cancer in the body.

Eligibility:

- Men ages 18 and over with prostate cancer. The cancer must be newly diagnosed, have relapsed, or has spread outside the prostate.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with physical exam and medical history. They will give a blood sample.
* Participants will be divided into three groups.

Group 1: people with cancer only in the prostate scheduled for surgical prostate removal or biopsy at National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Group 2: people who had their prostate removed or had radiation therapy and now have a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) without other signs of disease.

Group 3: people whose cancer has spread to other areas of the body.

* Participants will have 18F-DCFBC injected into a vein then imaged in a positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) camera. During the scans, they will lie on their back on the scanner table.
* Group 1 will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. A tube will be placed in the rectum. Coils may be wrapped around the outside of the pelvis. Participants will have a contrast agent injected through an intravenous line.
* Group 3 will have another PET/CT scan with a different radiotracer, 18F NaF, within 21 days of the 18F-DCFBC scan to look for prostate cancer in the bone.
* Group 3 will repeat the two PET/CT scans 4-6 months after the initial scans.

Despite these differences in composition, both sugars possess identical energy contribution on a gram to gram basis (4). However, the higher ratio of fructose to glucose in HFCS has led to the hypothesis that HFCS may uniquely contribute to cardiometabolic risk, more so than sucrose, through proposed differences in fructose metabolism, endocrine and hedonic properties (5).

Recognition of advanced HF is a challenge for physicians and under referral for advanced management is a considerable problem. There are excellent treatment options for patients with advanced HF, i.e. heart transplantation or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation, and outcomes with these therapies are considerably better if patients are treated before irreversible end-organ damage occurs. International consensus highlights the importance of timely recognition and referral of these patients to advanced HF centers.

The investigators aim to screen patients with symptomatic HFrEF who are followed in Danish HF clinics in the Copenhagen region with echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise test, 6 minute walk test, and NT-proBNP. The investigators hypothesize that 20% of patients with symptomatic heart failure followed in HF clinics in the Copenhagen Region will fulfill the modified criteria for advanced HF from the HFA-ESC (primary end-point in the study)(Reference 1). Patients who are identified with advanced HF will be offered right heart catheterization, guided by ultrasound and inserted through the internal jugular vein, determining pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac index, central venous pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, and central venous oxygen saturation. Patients not fulfilling criteria for advanced HF will be offered right heart catheterization consecutively until 50 patients have been examined (this group will be a comparator group to the patients with advanced HF).

Patients identified with advanced HF will be offered listing for HTx or LVAD if an indication without a contraindication is present.

The value of EEG is its high temporal specificity, enabling precision in the timing of social behavior to be addressed. In order to elicit social responses in the human brain, a variety of social and emotional visual stimuli will be presented during EEG recording, namely infant and adult faces and houses. Brain responses after intranasal oxytocin will then be compared with placebo, to examine the effect of intranasal oxytocin on central nervous system activity.

Specifically addressing whether the level of depression symptomatology in participants and whether this is associated with the neural correlates of social and non-social perception during both intervention and placebo visits. It is not yet known the extent to which variation in depression symptoms are associated with this methodology, although prior research has suggested depression modulates the neural response to social cues. This measure includes a question regarding suicidal ideation and therefore it is acknowledged there may be a safety issue in response to the questionnaire.

It is not yet known the extent to which variation in anxiety symptoms are associated with this methodology, although prior research has suggested anxiety modulates the neural response to social cues. Scores range from 20-80 and a higher score on both state and trait measures indicate higher levels of anxiety. A potential clinical cut off has been proposed for participants scoring over 39-40 as being high anxious., Within 20 minutes of study visit commencing|Stress, The investigators will measure current levels of stress by using the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen et al., 1983). It is not yet known the extent to which variation in perceived stress is associated with this methodology, but it is anticipated stress will be associated with levels of depression and anxiety in the sample. The PSS consists of 14 items, with scores ranging from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating higher levels of perceived stress. A score of 21+ is considered to indicate that participants have higher than average stress., Within 20 minutes of study visit commencing|Early Experience, The investigators will employ the Parental Bonding Instrument (Parker, Tupling, \& Brown, 1979) to assess the early relationship experiences participants have with their caregivers. Existing research employing intranasal oxytocin suggests that the quality of early relationships may impact the strength of any modulation of brain or behavior by oxytocin administration and therefore this variable will be included in the analyses in support of this hypothesis. There are 12 items that capture parental care and 13 items that capture parental overprotection. Items are scored on a 4-point likert scale from ""very like"" to ""very unlike"". The PBI is typically scored by identifying optimal (High Care Scores, Low Protection Scores) and less optimal (Low Care Scores, Low Protection Scores) scores on the mother and father subscales (NB: protection refers to overprotection).

Background:

* Parents and families of children with chronic illnesses have stressors, including financial stress, role strains, separations, and interruptions in daily routines and plans for the future. All of these experiences may lead directly and indirectly to parental stress.
* The number of families headed by single or lone parents is increasing. Little work has been done to better understand if the needs of parents who are providing care for a child on their own differ from parents who do not classify themselves as lone. Identifying parents who may need additional support within a pediatric oncology setting is very important so that appropriate support is provided.

Objectives:

- To better understand the social, emotional, and practical effects of lone parents on children with cancer.

Eligibility:

* All parents whose child has been diagnosed with cancer between 6 and 18 months before enrolling on the study.
* Participants must be able to speak and read English

Design:

* Parents will be asked to complete a questionnaire during one of their child s clinic or hospital visits.
* The questionnaire will ask about the parenting experience since the child was diagnosed with cancer. It will ask about the support the parent has received from family and friends since the diagnosis.
* The questionnaire will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.",NO,Cancer,,,,National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,275,NIH,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2009-08-06,,2018-03-08,2009-09-01,,2019-12-17,"University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States|Miller Children's Hospital, Long Beach, California, United States|National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States|Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, United States|University Of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, Mississippi, United States|Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, 10021, United States|Akron Children's Hospital, Akron, Ohio, United States|Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma, United States|St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, 38105, United States|Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States",

France has also been heavily impacted, with over 39.8 million infections and 167,000 deaths.

SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes an upper respiratory tract infection transmitted through the air. When it reaches the lungs, it leads to a severe acute respiratory illness called COVID-19. The body's response to this viral assault primarily occurs at the level of the respiratory mucosa.

This mucosal response is complex, involving various levels of activity. Mucosal immunity is therefore essential for an adequate and long-term immune response against viral respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 triggers a humoral immune response with the production of antibodies in the blood (serum antibodies) and antibodies in the upper respiratory tract (mucosal antibodies). It also induces a cellular immune response by activating specific blood T lymphocytes.

Tests used to measure the humoral blood response against SARS-CoV-2 and their neutralizing capacity are now well identified, as are tests for assessing the serum cellular T lymphocyte response. However, tests for measuring mucosal immune responses are not routinely used.

Our study aims to develop and qualify methods for analyzing mucosal immunity directed against SARS-CoV-2. These methods will be essential for a more precise analysis of the body's mucosal response to this virus.

NCT03613779,CLUSTER-HF: Lung Ultrasound Guided Therapy in Heart Failure,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03613779,CLUSTER-HF,COMPLETED,"Introduction: Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization among adults \>65 years of age. Discharge from a heart failure hospitalization is followed by a 30 day readmission rate of ≈24%. Readmissions for heart failure are typically preceded by a gradual rise in ventricular filling pressures that begins days or weeks before any detectable changes in clinical status.

Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a tool that is easily available at bedside and shows superior sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary congestion when compared with X ray or physical examination, even in the absence of symptoms.

Pulmonary congestion assessed by LUS identifies a subgroup with worse prognosis and a higher rate of readmission and mortality. Whether the implementation of lung ultrasound in the follow up of heart failure patients may reduce the rate of readmissions is unknown.

Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate a protocol of lung ultrasound guided therapy to prevent readmissions in heart failure outpatients.

Study design: the design of the investigator's study is a single center, single blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial.

Eligibility criteria: patients older than 18 years of age, who have been hospitalized for an acute heart failure syndrome. Exclusion criteria are life expectancy of less than 6 months, a surgically correctable cause of heart failure or uninterpretable lung ultrasound.

Eligible patients will be randomized into either ""LUS-guided therapy group"" or ""control group"" at hospital discharge. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 15 days, 45 days, 3 months and 6 months after hospital discharge. LUS will be performed in all patients at hospital discharge and in every follow-up visit, but only in those allocated to the ""LUS-guided therapy group"" the information will be provided to the treating physician.

In the ""LUS-guided therapy group"", a prespecified diuretic dose will be administered to patients depending on the degree of ultrasonographic pulmonary congestion: if congestive (3 or more B lines, in total) a high dose (80-120mg furosemide PO/day) will be prescribed; if no congestive (less than 3 B lines, in total) a low dose (up to 40mg PO/day) will be prescribed.

The main questions this study aims to answer are:

* Is DECIDES acceptable, usable, and feasible for AYA, caregivers, and oncology health care providers?
* Is DECIDES helpful for AYA, caregivers, and oncology health care providers that are making cancer treatment decisions together?

AYA and caregiver participants will complete a questionnaire and be randomly assigned to participate in one of three groups: (1) Usual Care, (2) DECIDES, or (3) DECIDES + Coach. Participants in 'Usual Care' will continue to have access to their oncology health care team for questions related to cancer and cancer treatment, as per usual standard of care. Participants in both 'DECIDES' and 'DECIDES + Coach' groups will receive access to DECIDES, and those in 'DECIDES + Coach' will receive additional live, coach-assisted support. After 8 weeks, AYA and caregivers will complete a follow-up questionnaire and those in the 'DECIDES' and 'DECIDES + Coach' groups will complete a semi-structured qualitative interview. Oncology health care providers of participating AYA will be invited to participate in a questionnaire and semi-structured qualitative interview.

NCT02576379,The Impact of a Helicopter Emergency Medical System on Prognosis in Stroke Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02576379,,COMPLETED,"Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, and 15 million people suffer a stroke each year; one-third die and one-third are left permanently disabled. Because the risk of stroke increases with age, it has been considered a disease of the elderly, but stroke also occurs in middle-aged people.

Thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the preferred choice of reperfusion therapy of ischemic stroke if performed within 4.5 hours from symptom onset. Time to thrombolysis is associated with improved outcome: the sooner the treatment, the less risk of serious - and possibly permanent - damage to the brain. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of stroke patients make it to thrombolysis within the 4.5-hour; one explanation may be system delays including prolonged transportation.

In May 2010, the first physician-staffed Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) was implemented in the Eastern part of Denmark. An observational study evaluating the short-term effects of HEMS implementation compared patients transported by conventional ground ambulance (Ground Emergency Medical Service (GEMS)) to patients transported by HEMS. Patients transported by helicopter had increased time to specialized care. However, both 30-day and 1-year mortality was slightly lower in patients transported by HEMS, although not significant, as was the degree of disability at three months measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).",NO,Thrombolysis,,"Risk of death during follow-up, Mortality during the follow-up period will be analysed for differences between GEMS and HEMS.

NCT01540279,Clinical Outcome in View of Surgical Site Infection (SSI) With Antibacterial Skin Sutures,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01540279,,TERMINATED,"Background: Poor wound healing and the development of surgical site infection (SSI) continue to occur and remain a significant cause of disability among operated patients. In spite of the substantial advances in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis and prevention it remains one of the most common complications in conventional abdominal surgery with an incidence in the literature between 4% and 17%. As it is known that surgical sutures potentiate the development of wound infection the search for an ideal suture material, suitable for all purposes has been pursued by surgeons for decades.

Hypothesis: In line with in-vitro results the investigators hypothesize that the use of antibacterial skin sutures with triclosan poliglecaprone 25 reduces the rate of SSI after open abdominal surgery Methods: To prevent microbial colonization of suture material in operative wounds and therefore to prevent SSI, triclosan-coated poliglecaprone 25 suture materials with antibacterial activity will be tested against un-coated suture material for skin closure after open abdominal surgery of 200 patients. The study is planed as a single center, randomized controlled trial. After ethical approval the patients will be consecutively enrolled from 2011 to 2012 in the Department of Visceral Surgery, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. The patients will be followed for 30 days (day 3,7 and 30) to detect and document wound complications. Wound complications will be classified according to Center for Disease Control and Prevention Standard guidelines. Data will be collected and the rate of SSI will be analysed in both groups.

Expected value of the proposed project: If the investigators can confirm the proposed hypothesis in our study this could be a promising and feasible approach to lower SSI after open abdominal surgery and might be also used in other surgical fields.

People with lumbar spinal stenosis may be at increased risk of obesity given walking limitations. Spinal stenosis is a very common degenerative condition in people over 45. People with this condition have pain and numbness in the legs during walking, and therefore avoid physical activity. Lack of physical activity is related to weight gain and increased risk of chronic disease. Objective: The objective of this project is test a new e-health (online) pedometer and nutrition intervention aimed at promoting weight loss and increasing physical activity in overweight and obese individuals with spinal stenosis. Methods: The investigators will recruit 88 people with lumbar spinal stenosis who are overweight or obese. Half of these people will receive the 12-week intervention, and the other half will receive usual care (no intervention). In Weeks 1 and 6, people in the intervention group will meet with a Registered Dietitian and an Exercise Physiologist for personalized sessions. They will receive a pedometer and instructions on how to log in to the e-health site (https://sspanli.mtroyal.ca).

NCT06312579,At-Home Exercise Study for Veterans With Healed Diabetic Foot Ulcers,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06312579,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Foot ulcers and amputations are a common and feared complication for people with diabetes. People with a diabetic foot ulcer have a higher risk of dying within five years than people with diabetes without an ulcer. At least one in four people with a new diabetic foot ulcer will die within five years, largely due to cardiovascular causes. The reasons for this increased mortality involve decreased mobility.

People with a recently healed diabetic foot ulcer are considered ""in remission"" as opposed to ""cured"" because the underlying medical problems which led to their ulcer are still present. Once in remission, the current standard of care is to slowly increase ambulation. The problem is that people rarely return to the recommended level of mobility. The ability to safely maintain mobility with aging is critical.

This pilot study is a small clinical trial to test the feasibility and acceptability of a home-based exercise regimen. The investigators will also assess if this home-based exercise regimen can increase mobility and function without increasing diabetic foot ulcer recurrence by improving lower extremity strength, lower extremity tissue perfusion and glycemic control.",NO,Diabetic Foot Ulcer,BEHAVIORAL: 12-week home based exercise|BEHAVIORAL: 12-week standard of care,"Gait speed, Usual gait speed will be calculated based on a 10-meter walk distance.

Scores are on a scale of 0 (healthy) to 10 (death from MS) with 0.5 unit increments, Month 12, month 24 and month 36|Expanded Disability Status Scale trend, EDSS trend is measured by differentiating patients who stabilize from those who experience an increase of EDSS score (increment of ≥1 or ≥0.5 point if baseline EDSS was ≤5.0 or ˃5.0, respectively). Moreover, patients with progression will be categorized as patients with continuous disability accrual (CDA) or one-step worsening (OneS-wors), defined as:

* OneS-wors: the occurrence of one single episode of confirmed EDSS deterioration.
* CDA: occurrence of at least two episodes of OneS-wors associated with continuous disability progression between at least two time points., Month 12, month 24 and month 36|Proportion of patients with No Evidence of Disease Activity (NEDA)-3, NEDA-3 is defined as no Confirmed disability progression (CDP), no confirmed relapse and absence of T1 gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions., Month 12, month 24 and month 36|UK Neurological Disability Scale (UKNDS), The UKNDS is a questionnaire for recording impairments in MS from the patient's perspective and considers 12 functional systems: perception and thinking, mood, vision, speech and communication, swallowing, arm and hand function, walking ability, bladder function, bowel function, fatigue, sexuality, pain, cramps and others. Answering the questions results in a score of 0 (no disability) to 60 (maximum disability). This questionnaire will be completed by the patients during site visits., Baseline, month 3, month 6, month 12, month 18, month 24, month 30 and month 36|Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC), The FSMC is a patient questionnaire for the clarification of cognitive and motor fatigue, a typical symptom of MS (Penner et al., 2009), and considers a cognitive, motor and total score. Score ranges from 200 to 100, the greater the score the greater the impairment caused by fatigue., Baseline, month 3, month 6, month 12, month 18, month 24, month 30 and month 36|Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), The HADS has seven items each for depression and anxiety subscales. Scoring for each item ranges from zero to three, with three denoting highest anxiety or depression level. A total subscale score of \>8 points out of a possible 21 denotes considerable symptoms of anxiety or depression.

Calculations of scores: each of the 14 items is rated on a 4-point scale ('Yes, definitely', 'Yes, sometimes', 'No, not much' and 'No, not at all'). All items except 7 and 10 are scored as 'Yes, definitely' = 3 to 'No, not at all' = 0. Items 7 and 10 are scored as 'Yes, definitely' = 0 to 'No, not at all' = 3. The HADS consists of two sub-scores: the HAD-A for anxiety and HAD-D for depression; each sub-score ranges from 0 to 21 points; scores ≥11 indicate the presence of anxious or depressive disorders; scores between 8-10 points are borderline abnormal, and scores of ≤7 indicate that the disorder is not present., Baseline, month 3, month 6, month 12, month 18, month 24, month 30 and month 36|Symbol Digit Modality test (SDMT), The SDMT is a sensitive and specific test to investigate attention, concentration and information processing speed, which are typically impaired in cognitively impaired MS patients.

Nine numbers are shown paired with 9 corresponding individual symbols. Below this are further lines with symbols and empty boxes. The patients must assign the correct numbers to the symbols as quickly as possible. The number of correctly assigned numbers within 90 seconds gives the test score. The total duration of the test is about 5 minutes and scores range between 0 and 110 where higher scores indicate better result.

A deterioration of the SDMT score by ≥4 points is considered clinically relevant, Baseline, month 3, month 6, month 12, month 18, month 24, month 30 and month 36|Clinical Global Impression (CGI), The CGI scale represents a short, independent assessment by the treating physician of the overall condition of the patient.

It incorporates patient history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior and the influence of symptoms on the patient's functional ability. The CGI consists of three different global measures and all three will be evaluated: Severity of illness (CGI-S) ranges from 0 to 7, Global Improvement (CGI-I) ranges from 0 to 7 and Efficacy index (CGI-E) ranges from 0 to 16. A higher score means a severe impact on the disease., Baseline, month 3, month 6, month 12, month 18, month 24, month 30 and month 36|MS activity status (MS-AS) - number of relapse, Number of relapse, number of relapse that affects the daily activities, number of relapse that required an hospitalization and number of treated relapse to be collected, Baseline, month 3, month 6, month 12, month 18, month 24, month 30 and month 36|MS activity status (MS-AS) - Number of patients with presence of symptoms, Number of patients with presence of symptoms to be collected, Baseline, month 3, month 6, month 12, month 18, month 24, month 30 and month 36|T25-foot-walk, The T25-FW is an objective and quantitative test of the lower extremities. The time in seconds it takes a patient to walk a distance of 25 feet (7.62 m) is measured. The patient should walk as quickly and safely as possible. This test is performed twice in a row and the mean value of the time required is documented in seconds. An improvement or deterioration of 20% is considered a significant change, Baseline, month 3, month 6, month 12, month 18, month 24, month 30 and month 36|9-Hole peg test, This test examines manual dexterity. Patients must individually remove nine pegs from a flat dish with one hand and insert them into corresponding holes in a test board. The pegs are then placed back into the dish with the same hand.

The five domains of mobility, self-care ability, daily activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression are considered. For each of the dimensions, the most appropriate answer from three given possibilities is selected (1=no problem, 2=moderate problem, 3=large problem). In addition, the patient marks the current state of health on a scale from 0 (worst conceivable state of health) to 100 (best conceivable state of health)., Baseline, month 3, month 6, month 12, month 18, month 24, month 30 and month 36|TSQM-9: Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication, The TSQM-9 is a questionnaire to assess patient satisfaction with siponimod treatment. The TSQM-9 is a sound and valid measure of the major dimensions of patients' satisfaction with medication and also a good predictor of adherence across different types of medication and patient population.

Effectiveness, side effects, simplicity and overall satisfaction are all rated between 0 and 100. Higher values mean a worse condition. Responses to items are summed and transformed so that higher scores indicate greater satisfaction. Specifically, TSQM-9 scale scores are computed by adding the items loading on each domain. The lowest possible score is subtracted from the composite score and divided by the greatest possible score range. This provides a transformed score between 0 and 1 that is then multiplied by 100. If more than one item is missing from a subscale of the TSQM-9 for a particular patient, this subscale should be considered invalid for that respondent., Baseline, month 3, month 6, month 12, month 18, month 24, month 30 and month 36|Exposure adjusted proportion of patients with adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) per 100 subject-years, Exposure adjusted proportion of patients with adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) per 100 subject-years to be collected, Up to 36 months|Discontinuation rates due to AE or other reasons, Discontinuation rates due to AE or other reasons to be collected, Up to 36 months|Proportion of patient who required FDO when starting siponimod and the reason why, Proportion of patient who required first dose observation (FDO) when starting siponimod and the reason why, Baseline",Novartis Pharmaceuticals,,ALL,ADULT,,134,INDUSTRY,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2022-06-17,2026-06-30,2026-06-30,2022-05-17,,2023-09-06,"Novartis Investigative Site, Ancona, AN, 60126, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, L Aquila, AQ, 67100, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Bergamo, BG, 24128, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Bologna, BO, 40139, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Brescia, BS, 25123, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Como, CO, 22100, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Catanzaro, CZ, 88100, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Foggia, FG, 71100, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Genova, GE, 16132, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Messina, ME, 98121, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Milano, MI, 20133, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Palermo, PA, 90127, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Padova, PD, 35128, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Pisa, PI, 56126, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Pavia, PV, 27100, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Roma, RM, 00133, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Roma, RM, 00152, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Roma, RM, 00189, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Orbassano, TO, 10043, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Trieste, TS, 34149, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Vicenza, VI, 36100, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Napoli, 80132, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Napoli, 80138, Italy|Novartis Investigative Site, Novara, 28100, Italy",

NCT03007979,Alternative Dosing Schedule of Palbociclib in Metastatic Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03007979,,COMPLETED,"The investigators propose to conduct a study to test an alternative dosing schedule of palbociclib. With the current three-week on and one week off schedule, a significant number of patients develop grade 3 or higher degree of neutropenia and require dose reduction and sometimes discontinuation. This potentially compromises the efficacy of the drug. In addition, as the half-life of palbociclib is 27 hours, 1 week break with the standard 3 weeks on and 1 week off dosing schedule could potentially lead to recovery of Rb phosphorylation during the off week. Hence, the investigators propose a 5 days on and 2 days off schedule each week without any weeks off drug. Although the cumulative doses each 28-day cycle is roughly the same with this schedule compared to conventional dosing, the bone marrow is not exposed to the drug continuously for 21 days and rather gets frequent breaks from therapy. The investigators hypothesize that the 5 days on and 2 days off schedule is more tolerable with less frequent high grade neutropenia and dose interruption/reduction. In addition, this schedule also provides for a more continuous drug delivery to the patient since there is not a week's break in therapy, which could ultimately prove to be more efficacious.",YES,Breast Cancer|Breast Carcinoma|Cancer of Breast|Malignant Tumor of Breast,DRUG: Palbociclib|DRUG: Letrozole|DRUG: Fulvestrant|PROCEDURE: Optional research biopsy|DRUG: Goserelin|PROCEDURE: Research blood draw|PROCEDURE: Circulating tumor cell blood draw|PROCEDURE: Tumor biopsy (optional),"Rate of Grade 3 or Higher Neutropenia, * The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting.

The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of iNeo-Vac-P01 in combination with anti-PD-1 and radiofrequency ablation, so as to provide a new personalized therapeutic strategy for patients.

It is known that cancer patients have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual patient and tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the participant's body fight any tumor cells that could cause the cancer to come back in the future.

NCT01813279,Assessment of the Subcutaneous Reinjection of Human Autologous Adipose-derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (Celution® System) in the Hands of Patients Suffering From Systemic Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01813279,,COMPLETED,"Systemic sclerosis is an autoimmune disease characterized by skin lesions and visceral responsible for significant morbidity. Microcirculatory disorders and tissue fibrosis are excessive severity of the disease. This condition can affect the hands with a major functional consequence severely impairing the quality of life of patients.

Adipose tissue is used in plastic surgery for over a century for the filling of depressions in the skin. In addition to the volume effect, a trophic effect on the surrounding tissue was noted. It is shown that the stromal vascular fraction is responsible for this regenerative effect.

In a previous study the investigators have demonstrated in a mouse model that the subcutaneous adipose tissue provides a trophic effect on SSc skin lesions by reducing the fibrosis of the dermis and providing a pro angiogenic.

Objectives and means:

This is a clinical study evaluating an innovative cell therapy procedure. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of injection of autologous stromal vascular fraction of adipose origin according to the system Celution ® (Cytori Therapeutics, Inc.., United Kingdom) in digital in patients with scleroderma cutaneous hands.

Eleven patients with scleroderma with the hands will be included in the study. Due to the nature of the orphan disease, a longitudinal study be conducted, where each patient will have own control.

The evaluation will be pre and post operative for a period of six months. This evaluation will be based on clinical criteria (trophic balance, functional) and laboratory (capillaroscopy, Doppler ultrasound of the arteries of the forearm, laser-Doppler tissue).

Project schedule and implementation phases:

The project will run over a period of twelve months. Patients will be followed for a period of six months. Analyzes clinical, paraclinical, and exploitation of results will be achieved over a period of six months.

Expected Results: This study will validate the functional and trophic effects of reinjection of autologous stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue issue on the fingers of patients with scleroderma.

NCT02779179,Therapeutic Management of Periodontitis and Clinical Manifestations of Rheumatoid Arthritis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02779179,ESPERA,COMPLETED,"Although RA pathomechanisms remains incompletely understood, periodontitis and RA share pathogenic features : genetic and environmental influences, chronic inflammatory disease, immunoregulatory imbalance, bacterial factors, persistence of antigen/peptide and clinical factors (conjunctive and hard tissues destruction). Several hypothesis can be evocated : Gram negative bacterial systemic spreading, inflammatory transmitter substance systemic spreading (IL1, IL6, IL17, PGE2), systemic spreading of bacterial degradation products (LPS for example).

Currently Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG) might be a susceptibility factor to RA because PG has an enzyme, the peptidylarginine deiminase leading to auto antibodies creation and RA increasing. As periodontitis, RA is chronic disease with a cyclic increase evolution, needing a complex pluridisciplinary treatment approach. Recent studies have reported an increased prevalence of RA patients with periodontal disease. Others studies show that periodontal treatment induces a significant decrease of the sedimentation rate and of the DAS28. Periodontitis is suspected to be an independent, aggravating factor in patients with RA (given the definition from NIH : an aggravating factor is something that makes a condition worse). So periodontal treatment cannot be considered as a RA treatment per se. But it is hypothesised that treating periodontitis in RA patients showing signs of periodontitis could result in improvement in RA disease activity. To date the role of periodontitis as an aggravating factor in these patients remains unclear, and only RCT designs can reasonably be used to test this causal hypothesis. There still remains some RA patients who have persistent symptoms and frequent exacerbations despite specialist care and continuous treatment, so results of treating aggravating factors are needed. As the majority of patients will benefit from a systematic evaluation and treatment of aggravating factors, the periodontal treatment strategy need to be tested.

The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to assess the effectiveness of periodontal treatment for rheumatoid arthritis patients.

NCT01863979,New Causes and Predictors for the Development of Atrial Fibrillation and Its Complications,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01863979,,COMPLETED,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and its prevalence increases with aging of the population. It is reflected in the ECG recording by the replacement of regular P-waves by an undulating baseline and irregular ventricular complexes \[2\]. The uncoordinated atrial activity prevents effective atrial contraction, leading to clot formation. Atrial fibrillation contributes significantly to population morbidity and mortality, and presently available therapeutic approaches have major limitations, including limited efficacy and potentially serious side effects. It can be classified into one of the three following categories:

1. Paroxysmal: self-termination within 7 days
2. Persistent: requires termination by pharmacological or direct-current electric cardioversion
3. Permanent: restoration to sinus rhythm is impossible or inadvisable

It is believed that in many cases the natural history of AF involves evolution from paroxysmal to persistent to permanent forms through the influence of atrial remodeling caused by the arrhythmia itself and/or progression of underlying heart disease. As many underlying conditions contribute to the development and progression of AF, the full and exact mechanisms standing behind this common arrhythmia are not completely or sufficiently understood.

Thromboembolism is by far the most important complication of AF, and the most common factor in stroke in the elderly. The determinants of Virchow triad, including stasis, endothelial damage, and coagulation properties, are centrally involved in AF- related thrombus formation.

NCT01021579,"Effects of Metformin Plus Simvastatin on Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS): A Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01021579,,COMPLETED,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy affecting 6.5%-6.7% of women in reproductive age, and is commonly associated with obesity, menstrual irregularity, insulin resistance (IR), infertility, and clinical hyperandrogenism and/or hyperandrogenemia (1,2). PCOS is also associated with increased risk of abnormal lipoproteins and hypertension, as well as cardiovascular or cerebrovascular morbidity (3). The lipid and lipoprotein profile in androgenized women with poly cystic ovaries is similar to the made pattern with higher levels of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and this abnormal pattern is independent of body weight (4). Insulin resistance is associated with reproductive abnormalities in women with PCOS. Improving insulin sensitivity through both lifestyle and pharmacological intervention can ameliorate these abnormalities. Insulin resistance in women with PCOS is common (up to 50%), both in obese and nonobese women (5), and disordered insulin action precedes the increase in androgen.

Treatment for PCOS subjects typically includes, implementation of lifestyle changes especially weight loss and adjuvant pharmaceutical intervention including oral contraceptives, anti-androgen therapy and insulin-lowering drugs (such as, metformin) (6). Metformin is a biguanide used extensively in type 2 diabetes. It inhibits hepatic glucose production and increases peripheral insulin sensitivity, but dose not cause hypoglycemia. Several studies have shown an increase in insulin sensitivity and pregnancy rate accompanied by decreased insulin and androgen levels in PCOS patients taking metformin (7).

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-COA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, and inhibition of this enzyme decreases cholesterol synthesis and a compensatory increase in the expression of LDL receptors in the liver. Statins reduce plasma triglycerides in dose-dependent fashion and also have a modest HDL-raising effect which is not dose-dependent (8,9). Furthermore, statins pose other cardio-protective properties, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions (10,11).

Some studies have reported that simvastatin decreases serum androgen levels in women with PCOS (12,13) by inhibiting proliferation and steroidogenesis of ovarian theca-interstitial cells (14). According to these previous findings, we hypothesized that combination therapy with simvastatin and metformin will result in lower androgen levels and cardiovascular risk factors in women with PCOS.",NO,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,DRUG: Metformin plus Placebo|DRUG: Metfomin plus Simvastatin,"Serum total testosterone, 6 weeks","Lipid profile BMI (kg/m2) Total Chol.

NCT01717079,rTMS and Body Shape Perception,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01717079,STIMOREX,TERMINATED,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a frequent, potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by a resistance to maintaining body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height, an intense fear of weight gain or being ""fat"" even though underweight, a loss of menstrual periods in girls and women post-puberty and a disturbance in the experience of body weight or shape. Body weight and shape dissatisfaction is linked to the development, maintenance and relapse of AN. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the inferior parietal cortex is involved in body image perception and less activated in patients with AN compared with healthy subjects. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is used to modulate cortical excitability, and particularly to increase excitability with high-frequency rTMS. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ""excitatory"" high-frequency rTMS over the ""hypoactive"" inferior parietal cortex of 54 patients with AN.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will compare effective rTMS (2000 ten-Hz stimulations per session, applied at 90% of the resting motor threshold, with 10 sessions in two weeks) versus placebo rTMS.

Assessments will be performed before rTMS and after the last rTMS session (immediately after, at 15 days and three months). The principal criteria for judgement is a body image satisfaction scale (Boby Shape Questionnaire, BSQ-34). The secondary criteria for judgement are eating behaviour scales (Eating Attitude Test, EAT-40; Bulimia test, BULIT and Eating Disorders Inventory, EDI-2), the Hamilton depression rating scale and Hamilton anxiety rating scale, a quality of life scale (Short-Form Health Survey, SF-36), a body composition analysis using a Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and the alpha-MSH autoantibodies levels (biomarker for eating disorders recently described).

Inferior parietal cortex rTMS could not only improve body image perception, but also help in the treatment of eating disorders, allowing weight gain with a decreased anxiety and improving patients' quality of life.

Phase II clinical trials test the effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug is effective in treating a specific cancer. ""Investigational"" means that sulindac is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved the use of sulindac for your type of cancer.

Participants in this study must have undergone previous chemotherapy and achieved complete remission, which is the absence of disease activity in people with a chronic illness, in this case AML. Unfortunately, a significant number of patients with AML who achieve a complete remission with initial chemotherapy eventually experience a relapse, often within a few months.

Previous research studies have demonstrated that a type of medication frequently used to treat inflammation, called a COX inhibitor, may suppress and kill leukemia cells. COX inhibitors work by blocking a class of proteins called COX proteins. Other commonly used COX inhibitors are ibuprofen and naproxen.

For this study, the investigators are using a COX inhibitor called sulindac, which has been FDA approved and used to treat pain and inflammation for many years, and has also been studied in suppressing certain tumors of the gastrointestinal system. The main goal of this study is to determine whether sulindac can help participants remain in a state of complete remission following the initial course of chemotherapy for AML, and two cycles of chemotherapy that is standard of care for your cancer, called consolidation chemotherapy.

Iron overload can result both from transfusional hemosiderosis and excess gastrointestinal iron absorption. Iron deposition in the heart, liver, and multiple endocrine glands results in severe damage to these organs, with variable degrees of endocrine and organ failure.

Although patients with iron overload often present endocrine disorders, the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying endocrinopathies are not completely clear. In particular it is not elucidated if the spectrum of endocrinopathies could change with advancing age. All endocrinological comorbidities can develop from a primary damage of the target gland, from pituitary secondary failure or from both.

The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of endocrinological diseases in adult patients with iron overload due to β-thalassemia or hemochromatosis and their impact on well-being and quality of life.

The study design is a prospective cross-sectional clinical study. All subjects enrolled will be evaluated for the endocrine diseases. The study protocol will include data collection from family and patients' history of diseases, physical examination, hormonal assessment for all endocrine axes and instrumental examinations.

2. Control Arm: paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) implantation as per standard practice.

Eligible subjects with coronary artery disease in a small vessel (reference diameter\<2.8mm) will be consecutively screened and enrolled based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria

The objective of the study is to assess the non-inferiority of the DEB to the PES as regards to primary endpoint of mean late lumen loss (LLL) at 6 months, defined as the difference between postprocedural minimum luminal (MLD) diameter and follow-up MLD, as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography and is based on the following assumptions:

1. The means of LLL in the 2 groups are precisely equal
2. A standard deviation in LLL of 0.5mm in both groups as demonstrated in the ISAR-SMART 3 and PEPCAD II trials
3. A non-inferiority margin of 0.25mm between groups is clinically unimportant

NCT05402579,Diabetic Ketoacidosis From New SGLT2i: Can Genomics Estimate Risk,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05402579,DaNGER,RECRUITING,"Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have revolutionized care for people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). They reduce a person's risk of heart failure, renal failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality, and potentially all-cause mortality. Remarkably, some of these benefits also extend to people who do not have T2DM. While the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are impressive, there is one life-threatening side effect associated with their use: diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The ability to predict which patients are at highest risk of DKA is needed to sufficiently mitigate this risk. Moreover, considering the impressive benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors, identifying patients at the lowest risk of SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA is also important so that providers do not overestimate risk in those who stand to benefit most.

Advances in genomic technologies and related analyses have provided unprecedented opportunities to bring genomics-driven precision medicine initiatives to the forefront of clinical research. Leading these developments has been the progress made by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) due to decreasing genotyping costs, and consequently, the ability to routinely study large numbers of patients. These approaches allow for systematic screening of the genome in an unbiased manner and have accelerated the discovery of genetic variants and novel biological processes that contribute to the development of adverse treatment outcomes.

By using innovative approaches, which harness large cohorts of population controls, sample size limitations that are associated with rare adverse drug reactions such as SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA can be overcome. The DANGER study represents a highly innovative new direction wherein partnership among basic science researchers and computational biologists will lead to the application of genomic techniques to identify genetic variants that may be associated with SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA.",NO,Diabetes Type 2|DKA|Diabetic Ketoacidosis,GENETIC: Genomic analysis,"Identification of genomic variants associated with an increased risk of SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA, Genetic ancestry will be calculated using principal component analyses and outliers will be removed.

Secondary objectives include determining if the intervention is associated with a reduction in emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations due to a fall, and examining five implementation outcomes: appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, penetration, and equity.

This study is a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial to test the effectiveness of a primary care clinician value champion for de-implementing PIMs among patients 65 years of age and older with a diagnosis of dementia. Medicare Part D pharmacy claims data will be analyzed at the end of the 12-month intervention for the primary outcome, the medication possession rates (MPR) for three groups of potentially inappropriate medications: antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, and hypoglycemic medications (sulfonylureas and insulin). In a similar fashion, a hospital admission, or an emergency department visit for a fall will be assessed at the end of the intervention using Medicare claims data. Finally, the five implementation outcomes will be evaluated at the end of the intervention from notes entered by the value champions in project workbooks.

Primary care clinics within each of the two participating ACOs will be randomized to either the intervention or control arms of the study. Prior to random assignment, the investigators will stratify practices based on high versus low historic prescribing rates. A primary care clinician from each clinic selected for the trial in the intervention arm (n=30 across the two ACOs) will be recruited as a clinician value champion for each intervention clinic.

The investigators' goal is to detect smart phone addiction among fibromyalgia patients and assess potential improvements in their quality of life and smart phone addiction after receiving fibromyalgia education.

Participants will report their recent exercise, social activities, sleep quality, and screen time for the past week. They will also complete the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR) to measure pain and physical function and the Smart Phone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV) to assess smart phone use. Diaries will track daily exercise, socialization, sleep, and screen time for 20 days.

The intervention group will receive fibromyalgia education, covering an overview of fibromyalgia, coping strategies, and discussions on the impact of digital addictions. This education, delivered via a brief Microsoft PowerPoint program presentation by a physician, aims to help patients.

After 20 days, all participants will redo the FIQR and SAS-SV assessments, and diary data will be collected.

This study examines how physician-provided fibromyalgia education affects pain levels, quality of life, smart phone addiction, socialization, exercise, sleep, and screen time based on patient diaries.

Metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) patients with PD-1 expressing immune cells are more likely to have larger more aggressive tumours and reduced survival and renal tumours that express PD-L1 are more aggressive with poorer outcome. Blocking this receptor/ligand interaction with monoclonal antibodies can restore the activity of tumour specific T-cells within the tumour with durable responses documented in early clinical trials in several tumour types including renal cell carcinoma. The study drug pembrolizumab is designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. SBRT will be given to the 1-3 most clinically significant lesions at the time of progression on pembrolizumab or at the 2nd course of pembrolizumab treatment in an effort to improve the activity of pembrolizumab.

SAIT301 is a novel humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the alpha chain of extracellular domain of c-MET. Binding of SAIT301 to c-MET blocks HGF binding and inhibits HGF-mediated signaling. Furthermore, SAIT301 also induces efficient c-MET internalization from the cell surface and subsequent degradation, resulting in inhibition of growth of the c-MET addicted cancer cells.

The sponsor decided to enroll subjects with tumors that express c-MET (by immunohistochemistry \[IHC\]) for this study, as the subjects with no c-MET expression are unlikely to benefit from SAIT301 treatment.

Stage 1 of this Phase I study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, and anti-tumor activity of SAIT301 administered as a single IV infusion in 21 day cycles, for up to 4 cycles. Subjects without evidence of tumor progression after 4 cycles will be eligible to continue on SAIT301 treatment if there is no evidence of tumor progression for a further 4 cycles (Cycles 5 to 8).

There will be 3 crossover treatments: PF-04965842 600 mg (A), placebo (B) and moxifloxacin 400 mg (C). Treatment assignments to PF-04965842 and placebo will be blinded to the subjects, investigator and Clinical Research Unit (CRU) staff (except pharmacist) but open to the sponsor. Moxifloxacin administration will be unblinded. Dosing in each of the 3 treatment periods will be separated by a washout period of at least 5 days

Screening evaluation will occur within the 28 days prior to dosing in the first treatment period. During each treatment period, eligible subjects who meet the entry criteria will be admitted on Day -1, prior to treatment administration on Day 1, and will reside in the CRU until completion of protocol assessments on Day 2. There will be a washout of at least 5 days between dose administrations in consecutive crossover treatment periods. After completion of the 3 study periods or upon withdrawal from the study, subjects will return for a follow-up visit approximately 7-14 days following last dose of investigational product. Further follow-up contact will be made at least 28 calendar days and up to 35 calendar days after the last administration of the investigational product to capture any potential AEs and concomitant treatments, and to confirm appropriate contraception usage, contact with the subject may be done via phone. For each subject, the duration of participation from Day 1 admission to follow-up visit will be approximately 10 weeks. The follow-up call will occur up to 4 weeks after the follow-up visit.

In each treatment period, the subject will be admitted to the CRU the day prior to dosing. Genotyping samples for CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 will be collected pre-dose in Period 1 only. The subject will receive a single dose of the assigned trial medication in the morning of Day 1. Triplicate 12-lead ECG measurements (approximately 2 minutes apart) will be performed on Days 1 and 2 of each treatment period as follows: -1, -0.5 and 0 hours pre-dose and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours post-dose.

NCT03113279,Mechanisms of Age-Related Muscle Loss,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03113279,,COMPLETED,"Two independent, but interrelated conditions that have a growing impact on healthy life expectancy and health care costs in developed nations are the age related loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia) and obesity. Sarcopenia affects approximately one third of adults over 60 years of age and more than 50% of those over 80 years, which is of concern when one considers that the most rapidly expanding population demographic in the UK is adults \>80 years of age.

Skeletal muscle is important in regulating blood glucose and insulin sensitivity. Thus, sarcopenia may play a role in exacerbating insulin resistance and progression toward Type II diabetes (T2D). Indeed, the highest incidence of T2D in the UK has been noted to occur in adults \>65 years. Obesity is a major risk factor for chronic diseases including T2D and cardiovascular disease. Progression towards obesity is associated with a concomitant decrease in muscle mass, producing an unfavorable ratio of fat to muscle. Thus, obesity in old age may exacerbate the progression of sarcopenia.

For the proposed study the investigators will conduct preliminary laboratory tests to characterize body composition, insulin sensitivity, systemic inflammation, aerobic capacity and muscle protein metabolism (in the fasted and fed state) in healthy older and obese older adults for comparison against healthy young individuals.",NO,Sarcopenic Obesity|Muscle Weakness|Protein Metabolism Disorder|Physical Activity,,"Myofibrillar protein synthesis rates via mass spectrometry, Postabsorptive and postprandial myofibrillar protein synthesis rates between groups and following the activity intervention, 2 years","Muscle fibre properties via immunohistochemical staining, muscle fibre type (i.e. I and II) and cross sectional area, 2 years|Muscle fibre lipid content immunofluorescent staining, Intramyocellular lipid content in Type I and II fibres, 2 years|Physical activity levels via accelerometry, Daily average time spent in sedentary, light, moderate or vigorous intensity activity, 2 years|Inflammation via plasma/insulin assays, Blood markers of inflammation, interleukin 6 and c-reactive protein, 2 years|Insulin sensitivity via plasma assays, Blood samples will be analyzed for insulin, glucose and hbA1C for indication of whole-body insulin sensitivity, 2 years|Body composition via dual x-ray absorptiometry, DXA-derived fat and fat free mass will be measured, 2 years|Intramuscular signaling via western blot, Western blots for phosphorylation of key anabolic signaling proteins, 2 years|Dietary intake via dietary logs, Diet logs will be assessed for total energy and macronutrient intake, 2 years|Daily step count by pedometer, Average daily step count assessed via waist worn pedometer, 2 years",University of Birmingham,,ALL,OLDER_ADULT,,38,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2014-08-01,2016-03-01,2016-08-01,2017-04-13,,2017-04-13,,

NCT04600479,Study on the Prevalence of Hepatitis C In a psychiatRic Population,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04600479,SaPHIR,COMPLETED,"Viral hepatitis, especially hepatitis C, is a major public health issue. Nowadays, very few studies in France have evaluated the prevalence of hepatitis C in a psychiatric environment.

In 2019, at the time of new treatments for HCV, it therefore seems essential to update the available data by estimating the prevalence of chronic active hepatitis C in psychiatric population. In addition to an update of epidemiological data, it is of high importance to assess the effectiveness of the care pathway for patients in whom chronic active hepatitis C is diagnosed, including the cascade of care, currently too inefficient despite treatments that are themselves ultra-efficient. Indeed, it is essential that once hepatitis is detected, it is formally diagnosed, then that the patient actually starts care and is adherent to treatment (take his treatment according to the prescription and until the end: this implies that the patient accepts his or her illness and understands the value of the prescribed treatments), to hope to cure the infection.

In this context, the SaPHIR study will allow to test a systematic screening of patients in an adult psychiatric environment, through rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). The objective is to promote the adherence of patients, and to assess possible obstacles in order to optimize the screening (RDTs), diagnosis (confirmation of only positive RDTs by venous sampling) and care management circuits in routine practice. In addition, the study envisages a combined HCV-HBV-HIV screening, taking into account the cross-infection risk (same mode of contamination, same risk population, frequent co-infections, more severe liver pathology in case of co-infection, etc.), thus making it possible to take care of the patient as a whole. The results of the SaPHIR study can ultimately be sent to the French health authorities to improve screening and care circuits, and their coverage by social security.",NO,Hepatitis C,"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Evaluation of the prevalence of HCV, HBV and HIV viral infections","Estimation of the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C in a psychiatric population, The prevalence estimate will be based on the percentage of patients in whom the viral C RNA is detected (greater than 15 IU / mL) in venous blood by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, among the patients admitted to one of the inpatient or outpatient adult psychiatric units of the hospitals participating in the study (around Nantes). The viral C RNA will be considered undetected in the case of a negative HCV RDT screening., 33 months","Effectiveness of the care pathway of the HCV-infected patient, Percentage of patients who accepted the RDT screening Percentage of patients screened positive Percentage of patients who accepted venous sampling to achieve the C viral load Percentage of patients diagnosed positive by carrying out the C viral load Percentage of patients (diagnosed as positive) having started a care procedure Percentage of patients referred to specialists Percentage of compliant patients Percentage of patients considered cured 12 weeks after the end of treatment, 33 months|Prevalence of hepatitis C in a psychiatric population (cured hepatitis and chronic active hepatitis), The estimate of the prevalence of hepatitis C will be based on the percentage of patients with positive screening by RDT (anti-HCV Ab), among all the patients included in the study., 33 months|Prevalence of active hepatitis B in a psychiatric population, The estimate of the prevalence of active hepatitis B will be based on the percentage of patients with positive screening by RDT (HBs Ag), among all patients included in the study.

NCT02835079,Treatment Effect of Tamoxifen on Patients With DMD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02835079,,COMPLETED,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive devastating disease that affects mainly boys, with an incidence of about 1:3,500 live births. The pathology of DMD is a result of non-repaired muscle damage that leads to muscle-tissue replacement by scar tissue, a process known as fibrosis. Currently, there is no effective treatment for the disease. The only therapy offered to these boys are steroids which slightly delayed the disease progression. The boys lose their ability to walk at around the age of 12, and die in the 4th decade of life from severe heart and lung problems.

In this study investigators will test the efficacy of Tamoxifen treatment in ambulatory DMD boys. Tamoxifen is a drug used for palliative treatment of breast cancer patients and has an outstanding safety profile. In addition, Tamoxifen was tested in the past in boys, for other pediatric indications, and showed an excellent safety with no side effects.

Tamoxifen is being tested in this study, as a therapy for DMD, for the following reasons:

(i) it was shown to have anti-fibrotic effect in multiple in-vivo systems; (ii) it assists in the repair of damaged muscles.

In other words, Tamoxifen is expected to have a synergistic effect on DMD patients, due to its dual mechanism of action. Indeed, Tamoxifen was shown to have significant beneficial effects in the mdx mouse model of DMD.

Microbial diversity refers to the variety of different species present in the gut microbiome. In this study, DNA extraction from fecal samples is carried out in two primary steps. Initially, the sample undergoes purification using multiple reagents and centrifugation. This process isolates the microbes by removing other fecal components. The next step involves lysing bacterial cells; this is achieved by incubating the samples in lysis buffer with agitation. Subsequently, the extracted DNA is amplified through techniques such as multiple displacement amplification. A 16S rRNA primer is then selected for gene sequencing.

Because ipilimumab has not been tested in children, adolescents, or young adults, it is considered an experimental drug. The purposes of this research study are to determine the highest safe dose of ipilimumab for children, adolescents, and young adults with solid tumor cancers; examine its effectiveness and possible side effects; and better understand how the body and the immune system process it over time.

Candidates must be between 2 and 21 years of age and must have solid malignant tumors that have been resistant to standard therapy. Volunteers will be screened with a medical history, a clinical examination, and computerized scans such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The pathogenesis of urinary calculi is not completely clear. Supersaturation of urinary components is a necessary condition for the formation of urinary calculi. The causes of stone formation are closely related to diet, drugs, metabolic disorders, basic diseases, genetic factors, environment and so on. Diet essentially determines the composition of urine, which affects the formation of urinary calculi. The effect of dietary phosphorus intake on stones is not clear. There is a lack of data to support dietary phosphorus as an influencing factor of stone formation. Phosphorus is present in most foods. 24h urine composition analysis is of great value in predicting the occurrence and composition of urinary calculi. However, due to the interaction between urine components, a single urine component can not well predict the occurrence of stones. Therefore, the researchers introduced the relative supersaturation of common stone components in urine to predict the incidence of stones. Therefore, we want to give healthy adults a diet with different phosphorus content for a period of time to clarify the effect of phosphorus in the diet on 24h urine composition level and urine relative supersaturation, so as to further explore the relationship between dietary phosphorus and the incidence of urinary calculi.

NCT01986179,Comparing Remote Interpreter Modalities in the Pediatric Emergency Department,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01986179,,COMPLETED,"Professional interpretation improves quality of care for patients with limited English proficiency (LEP). However, many health care settings lack access to professional interpreters, and even in locations with good access, logistical factors and perceived barriers have limited their widespread use. Remote methods of professional interpretation, including telephone and video, hold great promise for expanding access, but only limited data exist on the relative impacts of these modalities on patient care and provider uptake. Comparing how these modalities impact multiple aspects of health care quality, including family comprehension, provider communication, and consistency of provider interpreter use will inform dissemination of strategies for delivery of safe, efficient, and equitable care to LEP families.

Aim 1: To determine whether randomly assigned remote interpreter modality (telephone versus video) impacts parent-reported quality of communication and interpretation, diagnosis comprehension, and length of stay (LOS) among LEP Spanish-speaking families seen in a pediatric Emergency Department (ED).

Hypothesis 1: Parent-reported quality of communication and interpretation and parent diagnosis comprehension will be higher among families assigned to video interpretation compared to telephone interpretation.

Hypothesis 2: LOS will not differ between families assigned to video and telephone interpretation.

Aim 2: To determine whether assigned interpreter modality is associated with provider decision to communicate without professional interpretation.

In recent years, much effort has been focused on the biological markers for their potential values to diagnose ARDS and outcomes.

ARDS is generally accompanied by the disruption in alveolar-capillary barrier permeability, which subsequently caused an influx of neutrophils into the interstitium and alveolar space. It was reported that the aggregation, adhesion activation and release proteases of neutrophils are the key pathogenesis of ARDS pulmonary edema. Neutrophil Elastase (HNE), the most crucial protease generated in neutrophil azurophilic granules, plays an important role in various inflammations, especially the lung injury. The destructive action of HNE on almost all extracellular matrix influences cell signaling through cleavage of surface receptors. Once released in circulation, HNE is rapidly inactivated by conjugation with PI3. This local inhibitor reduces HNE mediated tissue injury and inflammation. Thus, the investigators plan to conduct a cohort study with repeated measures to examine the diagnostic and prognostic value of HNE and PI3 for ARDS.",NO,"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, ARDS",,"ARDS development-Berlin definition, 60 days|ARDS survival, 60 days",,Peking University Third Hospital,"Beijing Friendship Hospital|Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University|Beijing Xiyuan Hospital|China-Japan Friendship Hospital",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,500,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2011-01,2014-08,2014-08,2016-10-25,,2016-10-25,,

NCT00043979,Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With High-Risk and Recurrent Pediatric Sarcomas,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00043979,,COMPLETED,"This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of stem cell transplantation for treating patients with sarcomas (tumors of the bone, nerves, or soft tissue). Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow and blood stream that develop into blood cells. Stem cells transplanted from a healthy donor travel to the patient's bone marrow and begin producing normal cells. In patients with certain cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, the donor's immune cells attack the patient's cancer cells in what is called a ""graft-versus-tumor"" effect, contributing to cure of the disease. This study will determine whether this treatment can be used successfully to treat patients with sarcomas.

Patients between 4 and 35 years of age with a sarcoma that has spread from the primary site or cannot be removed surgically, and for whom effective treatment is not available, may be eligible for this study. Candidates must have been diagnosed by the age of 30 at the time of enrollment. They must have a matched donor (usually a sibling). Participants undergo the following procedures:

Donors: Stem cells are collected from the donor. To do this, the hormone granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is injected under the skin for several days to move stem cells out of the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Then, the cells are collected by apheresis. In this procedure the blood is drawn through a needle placed in one arm and pumped into a machine where the stem cells are separated out and removed. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a needle in the other arm.

Patients: For patients who do not already have a central venous catheter (plastic tube), one is placed into a major vein. This tube can stay in the body the entire treatment period for giving medications, transfusing blood, , withdrawing blood samples, and delivering the donated stem cells. Before the transplant procedure, patients receive from one to three cycles of ""induction"" chemotherapy, with each cycle consisting of 5 days of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone followed by at least a 17-day rest period. All the drugs are infused through the catheter except prednisone, which is taken by mouth. After the induction therapy, the patient is admitted to the hospital for 5 days of chemotherapy with high doses of cyclophosphamide, melphalan, and fludarabine. Two days later, the stem cells are infused. The anticipated hospital stay is about 3 weeks, but may be longer if complications arise. Patients are discharged when their white cell count is near normal, they have no fever or infection, they can take sufficient food and fluids by mouth, and they have no signs of serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-a condition in which the donor's cells ""see"" the patient's cells as foreign and mount an immune response against them.

After hospital discharge, patients are followed in the clinic at least once or twice weekly for a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests for 100 days. They receive medications to prevent infection and GVHD and, if needed, blood transfusions. If GVHD has not developed by about 120 days post transplant, patients receive additional white cells to boost the immune response. After 100 days, follow-up visits may be less frequent. Follow-up continues for at least 5 years. During the course of the study, patients undergo repeated medical evaluations, including blood tests and radiology studies, to check on the cancer and on any treatment side effects. On four occasions, white blood cells may be collected through apheresis to see if immune responses can be generated against the sarcomas treated in this study.

NCT04957979,Minnesota Care Coordination Effectiveness Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04957979,MNCARES,COMPLETED,"Medical care has improved greatly over the past 50 years. Treatments for most medical conditions can help us lead longer and healthier lives, but there are still problems. Many patients with two or more conditions see many different doctors and sometimes take more medications than needed. These patients can feel lost and confused. In addition, non-medical issues involving housing, food, transportation, employment, income, support from others, and language barriers can have a large impact on our health.

In Minnesota, many primary care clinics are using a method called care coordination to improve the health of patients who have a number of chronic diseases (some examples of chronic diseases include diabetes, heart disease, asthma and depression). With care coordination, a nurse in the clinic helps the various doctors, clinics, and specialists to work together, in the interest of the patient. In some clinics, a social worker also helps with care coordination. These social workers help with issues like housing, transportation, or employment. Care coordination can help reduce patient confusion. It also can improve health and lower patient burdens and costs of getting medical care.

To help find out what types of care coordination are most successful, we are proposing a study. Our plan is to track the health of patients receiving care coordination and compare two types:

A. Care coordination done by a nurse or other clinic staff B. Care coordination where a licensed social worker also assists the patient

In this study, we will measure many things, including:

1. Control of chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, asthma, and depression
2. Hospitalizations
3. Emergency department visits
4. Use of medications and diagnostic tests
5. Use of specialty care
6. General health status
7. Patient satisfaction and access to care
8. Use of shared decision-making (where the doctor and the patient make treatment decisions together)
9. Patient burden (how much time and effort the patient spends trying to get healthy)
10. Patients' out-of-pocket medical costs

This project will be important to patients because it could reduce confusion and fragmented care while improving all the items above. Those improvements will be more likely because this project takes advantage of engagement with patients and others. We have four patient partners who will help conduct the study and interpret and broadly share the results. The project was developed with the input from patients, clinic leaders, people from state government, and experts on health and quality care.

By measuring a wide variety of outcomes for the adults receiving coordination services in these clinics, we hope to identify the specific actionable information that will allow these and other clinics to improve their services for these patients with complex needs.

Sixty women (Experimental=30, Control=30) that applied to the menopause policlinic of a Women Diseases Training and Research Hospital were included in the study. Two women dropped out later, so the study was completed with 58 (Experimental=29, Control=29) women. Firstly, women were separated into two groups according to the cut-point of (26,55) in The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) (those who score 26,6 and above or 26,5 and below) and then these two groups were divided into intervention and control groups randomly. Data were collected with Descriptive Questions Form, Menopause Symptom Evaluation Scale (MRS), FSFI, Marital adjustment Scale (MAS) and Sexual Quality of Life Questionnaire Scale - Female Version (SQOL-F) between September 07, 2020 and March 26, 2021. The intervention group was given sexual counselling, prepared in line with the PLISSIT model, for three weeks, once a week and lasting approximately one hour. The effect of the counseling was tested twelve weeks after counseling was completed. Women in the control group were also interviewed twice concurrent with the intervention group; once when the counseling began and once during the last assessment. Women in the control group filled some data forms. After the study was completed, the counseling was also given to women who wanted it, in the control group. Frequency and percentage values, descriptive statistics, Fisher's Exact Test, Pearson Chi Square, t tests, for non-normally distributed data Mann Whitney U test and the Wilcoxon test were used for data analysis.

The prevalence rate in England is reported to be between 1-2.4%. OLP contributed to around 40% of all visits or 1,200 appointments in 2014 at the Eastman Dental Hospital. Pain, discomfort, long-standing use of medications, lesion recurrence and adverse side effects of therapy are commonly associated with OLP, eventually leading to a significant reduction in a patient quality of life. In addition, there is also increased risk of developing oral cancer in patients with OLP. The current gold standard treatment for OLP is corticosteroid, which can result in adverse side effects including increased risk of infections and skin cancer, reduced systemic immune system, and hepatotoxicity with long-term usage.

NCT04389879,"CAD/CAM Fixed Retainers vs. Conventional Multistranded Fixed Retainers in Orthodontic Patients. Comparison of Stability, Retainer Failure Rate, Adverse Effects, Cost-effectiveness, and Patient Satisfaction. A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04389879,Retention,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Introduction:

Orthodontic retainers are used after the completion of orthodontic treatment to assure dental occlusal stability and to maintain the achieved end-result. However, without retention teeth could go back to their initial dental malposition or could even take a different unpredicted position resulting once again in dental malocclusion (a deviation from normal occlusion).

There are different types of retainers, some are fixed (glued to the back of the front teeth), and others are removable (can be removed and replaced into the mouth by the patient).

While there are various retainers used for retention (stability), there is no perfect method. Fixed retainers (FRs) are used worldwide. On the one hand, FRs focus on preventing relapse. On the other hand, there are sometimes some adverse effects of retainers; they could fail at a certain point (break/get loose), or cause unwanted tooth movements. Until now, the choice of a retention method is based solely on clinicians' experience as there is no substantial evidence regarding the best retention method or the duration of the retention period. Some clinicians prolong the retention period while others prefer to keep the retainers for an indefinite time.

As the world is advancing, so is the orthodontic science. New FR fabricated by CAD/CAM (Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Manufacturing), are assumed to have greater accuracy, better fit, and most importantly, might offer a passive positioning of the retainer. However, the evidence about CAD/CAM FRs is very limited.

Purpose:

To investigate and compare the clinical effectiveness of two types of FRs; CAD/CAM vs. multistranded wire, in terms of stability (primary outcome), failure rate, adverse effects, cost-effectiveness, and patient satisfaction (secondary outcomes), substantial up to 5 years after retainer placement.

Hypotheses:

Compared to traditional multistranded FRs, CAD/CAM FRs have:

* Better long term stability,
* Similar failure rate,
* Fewer adverse effects,
* Similar cost-effectiveness and patient satisfaction.",NO,Relapse,OTHER: Bonding of either CAD/CAM or conventional multistranded stainless steel fixed retainer,"Stability, Change in lower incisor crowding will be assessed using Little's Irregularity Index (LII).

The definition of nonunion is a failure of the fracture to heal in six months in a patient in whom progressive repair had not been observed radiographically between the third and sixth month after the fracture. First of all good surgical techniques are stable immobilization must be obtained and local sepsis excluded. Then stimulation of the callus is required. Numerous techniques have been developed ranging from invasive interventions (including internal fixation with the use of bone graft or bone graft substitutes) to non invasive procedures (ultrasound and pulsed electromagnetic fields).

Recently, autologous cell therapy was presented as an interesting approach. The concept of such therapies is based on the effect of stem cells presented in the bone marrow and able to be transformed in osteoblast cells.

They are mainly due to bone pathologies, including osteoporosis. The latter leads to a reduction in bone mineral density and deterioration of the micro-architecture, with a consequent increase in bone fragility. However, the mechanisms of damage at the micro-scale have not yet been elucidated and there is no universally recognized damage criterion. Recent research has evaluated the importance of implementing computational models to study the influence of bone gaps, canaliculi and microporosities on the propagation of damage. These models need to be validated through experimental tests, still lacking, in particular on human bones, in the current scientific landscape. Once the experimental validation of computational models has been developed, it will be possible to introduce new fracture indices at the micro-scale, useful for a preventive diagnosis of osteoporosis.",NO,Osteoporosis|Fragility Fracture,PROCEDURE: Hip replacement surgery,"Number of lacunae interested by damage, We expect to observe difference in osteoporotic and non osteoporotic samples interested or not by the damage, six months",,Laura Maria Vergani,Ospedale San Donato,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,52,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2020-11-09,2026-07-09,2027-11-09,2021-03-09,,2023-12-06,"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Miano, Milano, 20161, Italy",

NCT05451979,HIIT in Pediatric Heart Transplant Recipients (MedBIKE™),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05451979,,RECRUITING,"Heart transplantation is the long-term treatment for children and adults with advanced heart failure. Post-transplant outcomes have improved over time, such that 50% of pediatric heart transplant recipients (HTR) remain alive with a need for re-transplantation 17-years following the initial transplant. With improved short- and medium-term outcomes, focus has shifted towards optimizing long-term survival and reducing transplant-associated morbidities. This includes strategies aimed at optimizing cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity levels.

Pediatric and adult HTRs have reduced exercise capacity compared with the general population. Previous groups have shown gradual improvements in heart rate response to exercise and exercise capacity in pediatric HTRs. However, after an initial improvement, exercise capacity appears to plateau, or even decline in pediatric HTRs, and remains sub-optimal compared with the general population.

Most exercise interventions in HTRs to date have focused on moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE), with some resistance components incorporated. More recently, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), consisting of short, intense bursts of exercise with rest periods, has been explored in the adult HTR population, with findings to date suggesting that it may yield greater improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness compared with MICE. Exercise interventions, particularly HIIT interventions, have consistently shown clinically important improvements in exercise capacity in adult HTRs that are linked with improved long-term post-transplant outcomes and well-being. Unfortunately, trials of exercise interventions in pediatric HTRs remain lacking.

NCT04982679,Relationship Between The Quadriceps Muscle Stiffness And Patellar Alignment For Healthy People,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04982679,,COMPLETED,"Patellofemoral pain is a common disease, and it often couples with patellar malalignment. Previously, imbalance of the different quadriceps muscle heads was believed to be a causative factor of patellar malignment. However, findings from electromyography studies on quadriceps activities and patellar alignment in the last two decades were inconsistent. In order to better understand the relationship between quadriceps muscle imbalance and patellar malalignment, shear wave elastography (SWE), which can measure the passive and active muscle stiffness, may shed some new lights to this area. This study aims to examine whether the quadriceps muscle stiffness can predict the patellar position. The healthy young adult will be recruited in this study. Active and passive quadriceps muscle stiffness will be measured with the SWE in different conditions and the result will be correlated with the patellar position measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Also, electromyography (EMG) activity will be measured during the active stiffness measurement so as to establish the level of agreement between the EMG and SWE data. Linear regression will be used to calculate the relationship between different factors. The total number of subjects needed will be 55 by setting an effect size of 0.15 with two predictors, 80% power, and α at 0.05 in the linear regression.

NCT01948479,Insole Optimisation for Ulcer Prevention: a Feasibility Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01948479,,UNKNOWN,"Insoles are designed to reduce increased loads and re-ulceration risk in patients with diabetes. The investigators previous research findings suggest that an instant insole solution may benefit some, but effectiveness is difficult to predict. The investigators propose a feasibility study using in-shoe pressure analysis to optimise the protective effect of insoles and footwear with the aim of reducing re-ulceration rates.

Early indications from exploratory case studies within the real world clinical setting suggest that by implementing the investigators previous published research findings the investigators can optimise effectiveness and reduce outcome variability of protective footwear and insoles provided to patients at risk of re-ulceration.

However a further randomised control trial is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of in-shoe pressure analysis in reducing re-ulceration rates within the NHS setting. The proposed feasibility study will recruit 20 participants from the multidisaplinary diabetic foot clinic Derriford Hospital and allocate them to either 1) Routine insoles and footwear provision or 2) Routine insole and footwear provision, and temporary insole provision with optimisation. The findings from the feasibility study will inform protocol development for a larger clinical trial. The results of the feasibility study will be used to strengthen a protocol for a grant application to conduct the main RCT.

Specifically, when breaking sedentary time which physical activity pattern- and intensity modifies the negative effects of sedentary behavior on glucose- and lipid metabolism? This lack of quantitative evidence calls for prospective experimental studies investigating the physiological and biological impacts of sedentary behavior, as well as the effectiveness of different strategies to reduce sedentary time. Thus, quantifying effects of the intensity, frequency, volume of sedentary breaks and/or physical activity on predefined outcomes is of importance.

Our primary aims are to investigate the effects of breaking up sedentary time on glucose- and lipid metabolism and thus examine whether physical activity intensity breaks during sedentary breaks matter. Specifically, the aims of the PhD-project are to provide knowledge on the following questions:

NCT05678179,The Feasibility and Acceptability of Utilizing Telehealth for Increasing Access to Bariatric Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05678179,,RECRUITING,"Bariatric surgery is recommended as the most efficacious treatment for patients living with obesity (body mass index \[BMI; kg/m2\] \> 40; or BMI 35-39.9 with related medical conditions). Adoption of telehealth services offers an opportunity to reduce barriers and expand access to high quality specialty care for patients considering bariatric surgery for treatment of obesity. Two important advances in telehealth services occurred during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Specifically, the patient's home is now the origin site for all services where patients are no longer required to travel to a designated telehealth location, and the use of telehealth has expanded to multidisciplinary health care teams. Our bariatric surgery care team has gained valuable experience using a combination of face-to-face (F2F) and telehealth visits for multidisciplinary evaluation in preparation for bariatric surgery since March 2020. Appointments that do not require a physical exam like nutrition, psychology, group education, and medical visits after completion of pre-operative testing are particularly amenable to telehealth services. Increased use of telehealth has the potential to reduce barriers to care (e.g., lack of access to accredited bariatric surgery treatment centers, extended travel time for multiple pre-surgery appointments), increase adherence to required program visits, and increase patient satisfaction. Patient satisfaction variables may include reduced time away from work, flexibility in appointment scheduling, and reduced physical demands of multiple F2F visits.

The gene effects function of the 60S ribosome by interfering with the function of the Guanasine triphosphatase elongation factor 1 in the release of eukaryotic initiation factor 6 from the 60 S ribosomal subunit for translation initiation. Seventy five percent of the individual affected by the syndrome have a biallelic mutation (258+2T\>C and 183-184T \> CT). The syndrome results in defects primarily in the pancreas and bone marrow resulting in pancreatic insufficiency, leukopenia with an increased risk of infection and an increased risk for acute myelocytic leukemia. Animal models that have knocked out the function of the SBDS gene in the pancreas reveals at the pancreas at birth as well as the insulin producing cells in the pancreas are normal but subsequently developed fatty infiltration and apoptosis without inflammation resulting in pancreatic exocrine insufficiency with initially normal endocrine pancreatic function. The endocrine pancreatic function declines over time such that by 12 months of age these mice show a phenotype of impaired glucose tolerance. The finding of early onset diabetes is not yet considered a manifestation of this genetic defect but likely is occurring. This study is designed to assist in understanding the prevalence of glucose abnormalities in this syndrome.

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency leading to diabetes is a common hallmark of cystic fibrosis and cystic fibrosis related diabetes. Prevalence of glucose abnormalities in diabetes is a approaching 50% by the 2nd and 3rd decade of life in this disorder.

NCT01774279,interNational Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer Tissue Bank and Database (iNATT),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01774279,iNATT,RECRUITING,"Anaplastic thyroid cancer has historically proven very difficult to research due to a combination of its rarity and the associated short survival period for those affected. In 2009, 2340 patients in the UK were diagnosed with thyroid cancer with 70-90 expected to be the anaplastic subtype 1,2. For these patients average life expectancy is in the range of 2-6 months with only a very small number surviving for more than one year. It is a highly aggressive form of cancer that is refractory to current treatment options. By collecting tissue and blood samples along with clinical data across the UK we will be able to accumulate numerically significant numbers of samples and data points which will facilitate research opportunities. Researchers will be encouraged to apply for access to the collected samples in order to try and establish the causal mechanisms for disease development, potential therapeutic targets and to relate clinical course and outcome with specific molecular defects. Due to the rarity it is not feasible for a single cancer centre or cancer network to accumulate sufficient samples for research in a meaningful timeframe hence the need for national collaboration in order to try and offer patients with this disease hope in the future.

All UK patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer would be potentially eligible. The project is expected to run for at least 15 years and all thyroid cancer clinicians will be encouraged to participate. Patients will be asked to donate surplus thyroid cancer tissue following routine biopsy procedures along with an optional blood sample.

2. Objectives

Primary Objectives The primary objective of this project is to establish a national anaplastic thyroid cancer tissue collection to help facilitate both basic and translational research opportunities.

There is no direct research question that the project itself addresses at this stage. The research proposals that subsequently arise as a result of this project will be generated by accredited research parties from the UK and potentially internationally. These research proposals will be submitted to the interNational Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer Tissue Bank and Database Project (iNATT) Steering Committee for assessment. As the volume of material collected per patient is expected to be of small volume, by virtue of the specimen comprising core biopsy or fine needle aspirate material, research proposals will need to be prioritised according to the potential benefits the proposed research offers. Priority will be given to projects that may lead to the identification of potential therapeutic targets. Each research proposal will require their own ethical approval and research and development assessments before commencing.

The steering committee will be multidisciplinary and will include nationally respected researchers and thyroid cancer clinicians.

Scientific Justification The long term objective is to try and address the current lack of understanding about the aetiology and progression of this disease and ultimately to develop new therapeutic interventions that may slow the rate of disease progression, improve quality of life and prolong what is currently a very short survival.

Due to the short prognosis following diagnosis it is notoriously difficult to run interventional therapeutic clinical trials in this patient population. Patients usually present with locally advanced and metastatic disease and as a consequence are often of poor performance status making clinical trial participation very problematic. If potential therapeutic targets could be identified in vivo it would potentially open up new therapeutic avenues whilst sparing some patients with the 'wrong' molecular profile futile treatment.

Recently, a new somatostatin analogue with a prolonged release formulation, Lanreotide autogel (L-autogel), has become available. It is a viscous aqueous gel, composed solely of water and lanreotide. Deep subcutaneous administration may lead to increased treatment acceptance compared with intramuscular depot preparations. It is more easy to prepare and is though to cause less local side effects and technical problems than octreotide LAR. Recent studies have been done to measure the efficacy and safety of L-autogel in acromegalic treated previously with octreotide LAR. These studies showed that L-autogel is effective and well-tolerated in these patients, with equivalent or better disease control and less gastrointestinal adverse events. Until now, there is no data available on the effectivety of L-autogel in patients with a dumping syndrome. Therefore, this study aims to establish the effectiveness and tolerability of L-autogel in patients with a dumping syndrome, previously treated with octreotide LAR.",NO,Dumping Syndrome,DRUG: Somatuline (Lanreotide Autogel®),"Responses to the dumping provocation test.

NCT01102179,Vitamin D Insufficiency and Deficiency in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Patients in Singapore,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01102179,,COMPLETED,"Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and is associated with elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration and mineral and bone disorder (MBD). There is also increasing evidence to show that these abnormalities increase cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in CKD patients. There is a need for early identification of vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency in CKD patients to prevent its long-term complications. However, the vitamin D status of CKD patients in Singapore has not been well described. The purpose of this study is to assess the vitamin D status of predialysis CKD patients in a tertiary academic teaching hospital in Singapore, and its association with parameters for MBD.

NCT04985279,Position and Angle Marking System (PAMS) for Ultrasound-guided Neuraxial Procedures,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04985279,,UNKNOWN,"Epidural anaesthesia involves the administration of numbing medication (local anaesthetics) close to the spinal canal, and is regarded as the best method for providing pain relief during labour and childbirth. The use of ultrasound to guide epidural insertion and placement has been shown to improve pain relief and reduce the risk of complications.

However, after identifying the desired needle insertion site via ultrasound, current practice involves demarcating the insertion site using marker pens, which is time-consuming, inaccurate, and may be inadvertently removed by skin sterilisation. Furthermore, the desired needle angulation determined by ultrasound cannot be accurately measured and maintained during the epidural procedure. Both issues limit the benefits of using ultrasound to guide the epidural procedure.

To address these issues, the investigators developed a Position and Angular Marking System (PAMS) that attaches on to the ultrasound probe. When the desired insertion site is identified by ultrasound, the doctor gently presses PAMS into the patient's back to create skin indentations demarcating the needle insertion point. These indentations are not affected by skin sterilisation, and may improve accuracy and reduce the time taken to perform the epidural procedure. Next, the angle between the ultrasound probe and the patient's back can be measured using PAMS, and this angle can be maintained using a needle guide during the epidural procedure.

The purpose of this randomised study is to evaluate the usability of PAMS and to identify areas for further improvement.

This study will involve up to 10 healthy simulated patients, and up to 30 volunteer ultrasound operators. After undergoing a standardised training session with a mannequin, the ultrasound operators will be randomly assigned to perform skin marking on the simulated patients as though they are performing an ultrasound-guided epidural anaesthesia procedure (no needle puncture will be made) using either PAMS, or standard clinical practice with marker pens. After completing the procedure, the ultrasound operators will cross over and perform the procedure again using either PAMS or standard clinical practice with marker pens.

Different modalities have been proposed to obtain regeneration of periodontal tissues employing various bone grafts, bone substitute materials, guided tissue regeneration (GTR), combination of bone grafts or bone substitutes with GTR, and growth factors.

So, a new, fully synthetic, nanocrystalline, unsintered, phase-pure hydroxyapatite (nano-HA) has been suggested as a potential material for enhancing periodontal and bone regeneration since its chemical composition and crystalline structure correspond to the calcium phosphate component of natural bone and may have greater potential for resorption compared with sintered hydroxyapatite.

A study performed in 2012, on 14 patients with paired intrabony periodontal defects of ≥4 mm participated in split mouth design study. The defects in each subject were randomly selected to receive nano-HA paste in conjunction with papilla preservation flaps or papilla preservation flaps alone. Probing bone levels from a customized acrylic stent and probing pocket depths were measured at baseline and again 6 months following surgery. No differences in any of the investigated parameters were observed at baseline between the two groups. Healing was uneventful in all patients. Both treatments resulted in significant improvements between baseline and 6 months in all clinical and radio-graphic parameters. In conclusion, they found that the nano crystalline hydroxyapatite bone graft in combination with collagen membrane demonstrated clinical advantages beyond that achieved by open flap debridement alone.

The concept of porous guided tissue membrane has been tested recently as a modality that could stimulate bone formation of critical sized bone defects. Kim and co-workers claimed that asymmetrically porous GBR membranes with dual BMP-2 and ultrasound stimulation may be promising for the clinical treatment of delayed and insufficient bone healing. For guided tissue regeneration in periodontal therapy, membrane perforations could allow for gingival stem cells and periosteal cells to take part in supracrestal regeneration. The perforated section of the membranes would stabilize supracrestal fibrin clot through mechanical interlocking of fibrin strands with the membrane pores providing more membrane and clot stability. It has been suggested that regenerative failures may result when the tensile strength of the fibrin clot is exceeded, resulting in a tear and a long junctional epithelium type attachment.",NO,Intrabony Periodontal Defect,PROCEDURE: Open flap debridment|OTHER: Perforated collagen membrane|OTHER: Occlusive membrane|OTHER: Nanohydroxyapetite,"CAL, Clinical attachment level, Change from base line to 3 months and 6 months","DOD, Depth of Defect (From cemento enamel junction to defect base), Change from base line to 6 months",Ain Shams University,,ALL,ADULT,NA,18,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",2014-12-17,2016-09-15,2017-03-25,2018-01-16,,2018-01-17,,

NCT01411579,Use of DwI-MR to Predict Chemotherapy Response of Liver Metastases and Hepatocarcinoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01411579,,COMPLETED,"One of the most recent and interesting field of diagnostic imaging is diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DW-MRI). Various studies evaluated the application of DW-MRI to diffuse liver disease and focal liver lesions providing controversial results, probably due to the difficult reproducibility of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements. It is conceivable that a wide inter/intra-individual variability actually exists in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-values, and that each apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-value presents an higher reliability in measuring the temporal changes of water diffusion within the same individual (longitudinal-evaluation), than in characterizing tissues between different patients (transverse-evaluation). For these reasons, some previous studies assessed the application of DW-MRI in predicting the chemotherapy (CHT) outcome in liver metastases. The rationale of these studies was the overt biochemical changes shown by the neoplastic cells after CHT and the sensitivity of DW-MRI in the identification of such changes. The same authors noticed that the metastatic lesions with the lowest ADC-values present also the best outcome after CHT. Moreover, these studies suggest that it could be possible to assess if each single patient will respond (R) or not (NR) to the CHT through liver DW-MRI performed from 3 days to 3 weeks after the beginning of CHT.",NO,Liver Metastases|Hepatocarcinoma,,"Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) value changes of the lesion during chemotherapy., Linear regression analysis to assess the association between the ADC-value changes and the CHT outcome., For metastasis: 2-4-8 weeks after CHT; for HCC: 30-60-90 days after CHT.",,Stefano Colagrande,Società Italiana Radiologia Medica SIRM|Treviso cà Foncello Hospital|University of Trieste|Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale degli Spedali Civili di Brescia|Santa Maria delle Grazie Hospital|Azienda Ospedaliera Niguarda Cà Granda|University of Rome Tor Vergata,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,57,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2011-02,2012-02,2013-02,2011-08-08,,2014-12-10,"Stefano Colagrande, Florence, 50134, Italy",

The relationship between metabolic and mood disorders may be mediated by endogenous opioid activity in limbic brain regions. We propose to examine affective state and μ- opioid system function in insulin resistant women, and change in response to insulin sensitizing treatment, through the following specific aims and hypotheses:

Establish relationship between insulin resistance, affective state, and μ-opioid receptor function.

1. Insulin resistant women will have greater μ-opioid receptor availability at baseline, and a larger response to stress challenge than non-insulin resistant women
2. Insulin resistant women will have greater negative affective state at baseline, and a greater emotional response to stress challenge than non-insulin resistant women.
3. Mediational analyses will reveal that the relationship between insulin resistance and negative affect is mediated by μ-opioid receptor function and neural activation in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens affect-regulating regions.

Examine effects of insulin regulation on μ-opioid receptor function and affective state.

1. Improved insulin sensitivity will be accompanied by decreased μ-opioid receptor availability at baseline and a reduced response to stress challenge. Degree of change in baseline receptor availability and response to stress challenge after treatment will correlate with degree of insulin regulation.
2. Improved insulin sensitivity will be associated with improved affective state at baseline, and with a reduced emotional response to stress challenge. Degree of change in affective state and emotional response to stress challenge after treatment will correlate with degree of insulin regulation.
3. Mediational analyses will reveal that the change in affective state after insulin regulation is mediated by change in μ-opioid receptor function and neural activation in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens.

The routine use of aspirin in these patients is intended to prevent the potentially catastrophic consequences of thrombosis. However, there is no routine clinical assessment of the platelet inhibitory effect of aspirin; nor have there been any prospective studies to assess the effectiveness of aspirin's antiplatelet effect in children after congenital heart surgery. No data exists to suggest that the first dose of aspirin transition from heparin infusion is either sufficient or insufficient in its antiplatelet effect.

In this study, the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of the first aspirin dose in its antiplatelet effects after surgery for congenital heart disease. Degree of antiplatelet effect will be evaluated with thromboelastograph (TEG) and TEG-platelet mapping study analysis. Thromboelastography is a clinical laboratory method of assessing whole blood hemostasis and allows for assessment of clot formation, strength, and stability. TEG is most commonly used in patients at risk for bleeding or thrombosis and also to monitor antiplatelet therapies (such as aspirin).

The investigators hypothesize: the first dose of aspirin transitioned from heparin infusion after congenital heart surgery is sufficient in its antiplatelet effect as tested by TEG and TEG-platelet mapping studies. Confirmation of the antiplatelet effect of aspirin will help support the current practice of empiric aspirin therapy to prevent post-operative thrombosis in children after congenital heart surgery.",NO,Congenital Heart Disease,,"Full platelet inhibition with aspirin 4-hours after surgery compared to prior to surgery, We will obtain thromboelastograph and thromboelastograph-platelet mapping studies at 4 time points: (1) prior to surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass, (2) 24-hours prior to the first aspirin dose, (3) 4-hours after the first aspirin dose, (4) 24-hours after the first aspirin dose (prior to the second).

The majority of these studies utilized trypsin to help isolate melanocytes and keratinocytes. Trypsin is enzyme that helps to separate the different layers of skin. However, some cell biologists believe that the enzyme dispase (which can be used to separate the epidermis from the dermis) is less toxic to cells of the epidermis and can result in a greater number of viable melanocytes and keratinocytes for transplantation.

The identification of factors predictive of the development of chronic shoulder pain is necessary to develop innovative and effective treatments to reduce the societal impact of shoulder disorders. In previous work the investigators identified a genetic and psychological subgroup that robustly predicted heightened shoulder pain responses in a pre-clinical cohort and poor 12 month shoulder pain recovery rates in a clinical surgical cohort. In this follow-up study the investigator proposes to test how interventions tailored to the high risk subgroup affect pain responses in a pre-clinical cohort.

The optimal theorized match for the identified high-risk subgroup is a combination of personalized pharmaceutical and education interventions. This combined personalized intervention versus a placebo pharmaceutical and general education intervention group is the primary comparison of interest.

NCT06354179,Evaluation of the Benefits of Administering Immunosuppressive Drugs as Single Daily Doses Over the First Year After Liver Transplantation (EASY),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06354179,EASY,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"World Health Organization considers non-adherence has a strong negative impact on the health of patients with chronic diseases. In transplantation, adherence to immunosuppressive drug regimens associates with late rejection and graft loss making it a critical determinant of patient outcome. The prevalence of non-adherence in transplant patients, including liver transplant patients, can be as high as 40%. Among others, life-long intake and complexity of immunosuppressive regimen make patients prone to non-adherence. For instance, non-adherence is more prevalent among patients with higher numbers of immunosuppressive drugs. One of the most commonly cited causes of non-adherence is forgetfulness and disruptions in routine, with the evening dose of twice daily regimens being the most likely to be affected6. Besides non-adherence, the constraints generated in everyday life by immunosuppression (including timely and regular drug intake) and the complexity of the immunosuppressive regimens represent a burden for the patients and are probably associated with a health-related quality of life deterioration. Therefore, long-term adherence and quality of life after liver transplantation might be improved by using a well-tolerated and easy-to-handle immunosuppressive regimen.

The immunosuppressive regimen after liver transplantation is in most cases based on different combinations of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids. While corticosteroids are administered once daily, tacrolimus can be administered either twice-daily (BID) as an immediate-release, or once-daily (QD) as an extended-release formulation. Among once-daily tacrolimus formulations, LCP-tacrolimus (ENVARSUS XR®) is approved for the prevention of transplant rejection in adult liver allograft recipients. It has demonstrated similar outcomes compared to immediate-release tacrolimus BID, in both kidney and liver transplantation. Mycophenolate has only been approved for BID administration, preventing from taking all immunosuppressive drugs once daily. Yet, single daily dosing would probably contribute to better adherence and quality of life in patients receiving a life-long treatment.

Although the half-life of mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active moiety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is compatible with once-daily administration, no published randomized clinical study has ever evaluated the efficacy and safety of MMF administered QD.

The narrow therapeutic index and wide pharmacokinetic variability of tacrolimus and mycophenolate justify individual dose adjustment by means of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), in order to minimize the risk of acute rejection and the occurrence of adverse events. For tacrolimus, TDM is generally based on the trough concentration (C0) and sometimes on the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), while for mycophenolate it should be based on the AUC of MPA. However, the dose adjustment of MMF in liver transplant patients is most of the time performed a posteriori, based on clinical signs of inefficacy of toxicity.

Limited sampling strategies with maximum a posteriori Bayesian estimation have been developed by our team for both molecules in adult liver transplant patients to estimate their AUC, which is considered the best marker of exposure for both. Therefore, tacrolimus AUC0-24h can be estimated by Bayesian estimation using samples collected before administration (C0), 8 (C8h) and 12 (C12h) hours after the administration of ENVARSUS XR®, or 1 and 3 hours after the administration of PROGRAF® and ADVAGRAF®. For mycophenolate, the MPA AUC can be estimated using samples collected 20 min, 1 and 3 hours after MMF administration, by Bayesian estimation.

Even if limited to 2 or 3 blood samples, tacrolimus TDM for ENVARSUS® requires late sampling (12h post-dose). To overcome the necessity of a longer hospital stay, microsampling devices (MSD) such as the Volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS®) device (Mitra®) can be used by the patients to take samples themselves, at home. Moreover, they are less invasive than venipuncture and collect low but accurate volumes of blood for analysis.

In this context, we propose a randomized controlled non-inferiority study to demonstrate that in liver transplant recipients, an immunosuppressive strategy based on single daily doses of LCP-tacrolimus (ENVARSUS XR®) and mycophenolate mofetil (CELLCEPT®) started at M6 post-transplantation is not inferior to XR-tacrolimus (ADVAGRAF®) and MMF administered BID, in terms of incidence of treatment failure (see below) at the end of the first year after transplantation, and to obtain adherence, quality of life and safety data. In order to compare solely MMF QD to MMF BID, patients on ENVARSUS XR® and MMF QD will be compared to a third group of patients receiving ENVARSUS XR® and MMF BID. A direct comparison of efficacy and safety, quality of life, adherence and exposure indices will be performed between ENVARSUS XR® and ADVAGRAF®.",NO,Liver Transplantation|Immunosuppression,DRUG: XR-tacrolimus QD + MMF BID|DRUG: LCP-tacrolimus QD + MMF BID|DRUG: LCP-tacrolimus QD + MMF QD,"Treatment failure, Treatment failure, defined by the occurrence of any of the following events: Patient death, Graft loss, Biopsy-proven acute rejection, rejection activity index score ≥4 according to the Banff criteria, month 12","Adherence to treatment, Adherence evaluated using the BAASIS questionnaire and patient diaries.

Two subscales will be calculated (participation, rewards and punishments) for CPSs and peers with SMI. Cronbach's alphas range from .73-.80 in people with SMI.

NCT04733079,Treat-to-target by Email During Urate-lowering Therapy in Gout,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04733079,GOUTEmail,RECRUITING,"Gout is secondary to urate crystal deposition after chronic elevation of serum urate level (SUL). Long-term lowering SUL below 360 µmol/L allows dissolution of deposited crystals and disease cure. There is currently a paradoxical observation: while urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is available and efficient there is an increase of gout prevalence and severity. The apparent failure of ULT in gout management is due to several causes including unadjusted dosage, no SUL verification, irregular follow-up and low treatment compliance.

In contrast, a nurse-led treat-to-target (T2T) strategy with regular adaptations of ULT until reaching SUL target allows gout cure in more than 90% of patients. We hypothesize that an electronic messaging-led T2T strategy will allow obtaining similar results.

Studies have reported lymphedema incidence rates of 39% to 73% following node dissection.

Lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA) has been previously used to treat established lymphedema. More recently, with imaging capabilities guided by blue dye and indocyanine green dye, the possibility of prophylactic LVA has become feasible. A 2018 systematic review of 12 studies utilizing prophylactic LVA during lymphadenectomy indicated a 2/3 reduction in the risk of lymphedema. The literature yet lacks any phase III studies with stringent controls and long term follow-up.

Objectives: To assess (primary endpoint) the impact of prophylactic LVA on presence or absence of lymphedema post axillary or groin lymphadenectomy and participant quality of life. To assess (secondary endpoint) the incidence of complications related to nodal dissection.

Methods: This is a phase III RCT, block randomized for upper and lower extremities, recruiting adult patients planned for an axillary or groin node dissection as a result of cutaneous malignancy. Analysis of rates of lymphedema and quality of life reports will be done.

Significance: Lymphedema is a feared outcome of surgical cancer care. Its impact on patients' daily lives is profound.

Some model-adjusted LS means are less than 0 and may be interpreted as very low rates., Baseline through 12 weeks|Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, A treatment emergent adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that either occurs or worsens at any time after the first injection of study drug following randomization and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship. The number of participants with one or more treatment emergent adverse event was reported. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module., Baseline through 12 weeks|Change From Baseline in Body Weight, Least Squares (LS) means was calculated using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with pre-study therapy, country, dose, visit, and dose-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline measurement as covariate., Baseline, 12 weeks|Antibody Production and Effects to LY2189265, LY2189265 anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were assessed at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks, and at the safety follow-up visit 4 weeks after study drug discontinuation (16 weeks). The number of participants with initial postbaseline detection of treatment emergent (defined as a 4-fold increase in the ADA titer from baseline) LY2189265 ADA at each time point were summarized., Baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks|Collection and Evaluation of Plasma Levels (Pharmacokinetics [PK]) of LY2189265, The population mean estimates and standard deviations were calculated for pharmacokinetic parameters (area under the concentration time curve (AUC) from zero to 168 hours).

NCT05327179,Effects of Action Observation Therapy and Video-Based Play Therapy on Children With Unilateral Cerebral Palsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05327179,,UNKNOWN,"Cerebral Palsy (CP) defines a group of permanent disorders in the development of movement and posture, which occur in the developing fetal and newborn brain, due to non-progressive disorders, leading to activity limitations. In addition to the traditional rehabilitation interventions used in upper extremity rehabilitation, a new treatment method, Action Observation Therapy (AOT), has been added recently with the discovery of the Mirror Neuron System. AOT; By watching the videos prepared, mirror neurons are activated and these activities are learned through imitation. Activation of mirror neurons strengthens voluntary motor movement by strengthening the affected nerve pathways or by creating alternative pathways. AOT is an easily applicable method as telerehabilitation because it is based on watching and replaying video recordings. Virtual Rehabilitation (VR); It is another treatment approach applied to improve the motor functions of children with CP and created with the contribution of developing technology. It has been reported that activities have a positive effect on motor learning due to their intense, task-oriented, active participation and high motivation. Within the scope of this thesis, the effect of AOT and VR to be applied at home, which has been on the agenda for upper extremity, on the trunk and upper extremity will be examined in detail and a contribution will be made to the literature.",NO,Cerebral Palsy|Upper Extremity Problem,OTHER: Action Observation Treatment|OTHER: Virtual Rehabilitation,"Sociodemographic Data Form, Information such as gender, age, clinical type, extremity involvement, dominant extremity, birth weight, assistive devices used of the cases will be recorded in the prepared sociodemographic data form, Before starting treatment|Joint Range of Motion (ROM) Measurement, Individuals' ROM degrees will be evaluated before and after the treatment using a universal goniometer in the supine position.

The scale measures a person's ability to manage daily activities that require the use of the upper limbs, whatever the strategies involved. The ABILHAND-Kids questionnaire assesses manual ability as a test focused on the child's difficulty perceived by the child's parents.

The questionnaire was developed using the Rasch measurement model which provides a method to convert the raw scores into a linear measure located on a unidimensional scale.

NCT01858779,Know Your Pulse Post Stroke-Measurement of Peripheral Pulse for Detection of Atrial Fibrillation After Ischemic Stroke,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01858779,,COMPLETED,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cause of cardioembolism and a leading cause of ischemic stroke. The diagnosis of AF after cerebral ischemia is difficult to establish even during the treatment at specialised stroke units, as paroxysmal episodes may terminate spontaneously before arrival at the hospital and do not always show early recurrence. However, the diagnosis of AF is of particular clinical relevance since adaequate anticoagulation is one of the most effective secondary preventive treatments in stroke. The detection rate of AF after stroke increases progressively by extending the duration and intensity of cardiac monitoring. For this purpose innovative medical devices and implantable event recorders have been suggested. However, high socioeconomic expenses, malcompliance and the invasiveness of some of these approaches currently limit their use to a minority of affected patients, while the growing number of stroke survivors is lacking access to free and simple screening tools.

For primary prevention, the measurement of the peripheral pulse (MPP) is currently the only guideline-recommended screening method among individuals aged 65 years or older. In contrast, MPP has never been applied in the setting of secondary stroke prevention, probably because several factors were expected to interfere with this simple technique, including sensomotor and neuropsychiologic handicaps of stroke patients 18.

It is the most common adult form of muscular dystrophy, with a prevalence of approximately 10 per 100,000 people affected. With 733 million people in Europe, we estimate that 75,000 people are DM1 patients in Europe.

The aim of OPTIMISTIC is to improve clinical practice in the management of patients with this rare disease for which no dedicated treatment is currently available. OPTIMISTIC is a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial designed to compare a two component tailored behavioural change intervention to increase physical activity against standard patient management regimes, with particular attention given to the definition of appropriate outcome measures and new clinical guidelines for DM1 management. The two components of the intervention are 1) cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and 2) graded physical activity and we will evaluate the intervention's effectiveness and safety against standard patient management.

Participants will be recruited from myotonic dystrophy clinics and neuromuscular centres in France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK.

At the end of the endovascular ablation procedure, the European Society of Vascular Surgery (ESVS) guidelines recommend the use of the compression stockings to reduce postoperative pain and the incidence of edema and thrombotic complications.

Despite this, the duration, type and degree of compression to be used, particularly after radiofrequency ablation procedures, remain a matter of debate. Furthermore, although the benefits of postoperative elastic compression therapy are well known, there is various evidence demonstrating how patients often experience poor comfort in wearing stockings, especially those with a higher degree of compression, which causes poor compliance with therapy. In light of all this, each center recommends the use of elastic compression stockings in the postoperative period with a degree of compression that varies, however, according to internal protocols.

NCT02139579,Efficacy and Safety Study of Bevacizumab Plus Chemotherapy in EGFR-TKI Resistant Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02139579,,UNKNOWN,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase is one of most popular target molecules in the field of anticancer drug research. EGFR is highly expressed in many types of tumor cells, which could activate EGFR cytosolic kinase activity by binding to its ligand EGF, and regulates gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis through different signal transduction pathways. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), competitive to specifically combined with the EGFR kinase domain, thus inhibits its kinase activity, thereby blocking cancer cell proliferation or metastasis. At present, EGFR-TKI has been widely used in clinical activity, especially in patients with EGFR mutations, which had been proved to achieved a certain effect. But with the passage of time, a drug resistance is inevitable.

At present, studies have found that the cessation of treatment immediately after EGFR-TKI resistance may lead to rapid progress of cancer. Chemotherapy, as one of the most widely accepted modality in cancer treatment, might also be one of the salvage therapies of target treatment. Therefore, in patients with better physical status (PS) scores, chemotherapy is commonly applicable.

In January 2010, a study published in the journal of Clinical Lung Cancer reported the application of chemotherapy as salvage treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with resistant to first-line EGFR-TKI treatment. Of the 114 patients enrolled, 67 received sequential chemotherapy, the other 47 patients received best supportive care. The results showed that, sequential chemotherapy can improve the survival time of the patients, compared with chemotherapy and supportive care groups (11.2 months vs. 3.8 months, P\< 0.01). Furthermore, in those who received sequential chemotherapy, a regimen containing paclitaxel got higher efficiency and disease control rate than those without (48.7% vs. 21.4%, 79.5% vs. 53.5% , P\< 0.05), as well as longer progression-free survival (PFS, 5.1 months vs. 1.8 months, P\< 0.01) and overall survival (OS, 12.7 months vs. 7 months, P\< 0.01).

Another study in Taiwan which enrolled 195 patients treated with at least 1 cycles sequential chemotherapy after first-line gefitinib shown similar results. Generally, gefitinib as a first-line treatment had PFS for 5 months, and the second-line treatment efficiency was 14.4%. Regimens of platinum or paclitaxel had a better treatment efficiency (50.6%). A poor therapeutic effect was reported for gefitinib as second-line therapy (5.6%). In total, the median OS of second-line treatment was 12.2 months. In addition, platinum containing regimens survival better (21.7 months vs. 8.9 months, P\< 0.01); patients with mutant EGFR benefit more in a platinum-based chemotherapy (24.5 months vs. 8.5 months, P\< 0.05).

Bevacizumab (trade name Avastin ®) is a kind of recombinant humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin gamma-1 (IgG1) antibody, which can selectively inhibit the combination process of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor, Flt-1 and kinase domain receptor (KDR) in endothelial cells. A reduction of tumor angiogenesis, blood supply, oxygen and other nutrients supply could be obtained after the VEGF loss of its biological activity, thus inhibit tumor growth. The drug was approved for the first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer in 2004 by America food and Drug Administration (FDA),thus became the first for clinical use of drugs that targeting VEGF. As the first globally approved anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibody drugs, bevacizumab has approved for advanced colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma and malignant glioma patients, which was used in more than 500000 cases. In the field of advanced NSCLC treatment, clinical results confirm bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy can prolong OS and PFS of patients with NSCLC, and well tolerated.

The thirty-fifth annual meeting of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) conference released a meta analysis results of bevacizumab combined with platinum chemotherapy for first-line treatment of advanced non squamous NSCLC. It is confirmed that, treatment with bevacizumab based chemotherapy for advanced non squamous NSCLC patients could achieve significant survival benefit, prolong remission time, and expected safety.

These disruptions not only reduce the hedonic pleasure derived from eating, but may also be detrimental to quality of life and could pose additional health risks (malnutrition) among patients with chronic illness or those enduring long-term complications from their previous COVID-19 infection.

Previous studies conducted among patients with cancer experiencing taste and smell abnormalities have indicated improvement in taste and smell function following daily lactoferrin supplementation. Lactoferrin is a natural transferrin protein that scavenges and chelates iron byproducts produced as a function of lipid oxidation in the oral cavity following inflammation, infection, or toxicity of chemosensory tissues.

NCT01655979,Medium-term Bedrest Whey Protein (MEP),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01655979,MEP,COMPLETED,"The human being has shown that he can live and work in the space environment, but due to the lack of essential mechanical load on muscle and bone, the fluid-shift as well as alterations in the acid-base balance (mainly on account of nutritional factors), the exposure to microgravity results in a gradual degradation of muscle, bone and cartilage, deconditioning of the cardiovascular system and metabolic changes. Countermeasures to prevent all the deconditioning of the physiological systems are not yet fully effective and require further investigation.

A commonly utilized model of simulating the physiological effects of microgravity on the human organism on ground is the 6° head-down-tilt bed rest. In the present study the model has been used to study potential countermeasures to spaceflight-associated deconditioning.

One of the most constrictive changes appearing during space flight as well as during bed rest, are disuse-induced muscle losses. These are associated with a decrease in muscle protein synthesis, rather then an increase in muscle protein breakdown. Besides an effective training countermeasure, nutritional countermeasures gain respect in this context: supplementing conventional diets with whey protein or essential amino acids has been shown to increase muscle protein synthesis. Due to these anabolic properties whey protein seems promising to counteract disuse-induced muscle wasting.

Drawbacks of a high protein intake are calciuric effects, ascribed to the proton-release when metabolizing sulfur-containing amino acids. The so called 'low grade metabolic acidosis' has also shown to activate osteoclastic bone resorption and muscle protein degradation. Therefore, to maximize the anabolic potential of a whey protein supplementation, the acidogenic properties need to be compensated. As previous works suggest, a shift of acid base balance into the acid direction and the resulting changes in bone and protein turnover may be hindered by supplementing alkaline mineral salts.

In this regard, a mid-term bed rest study was performed in order to investigate the effect of a combined whey protein (0.6 g/kg body weight/day) and potassium bicarbonate (90 mmol/day) supplementation as a potential countermeasure to multiple physiological and metabolic alterations on the human body resulting from real and simulated microgravity.",NO,Countermeasure Evaluation,DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Whey Protein + Potassium bicarbonate|OTHER: Control,"Change in body composition, Baseline, after 21 days of bed rest","Plasma Volume, Baseline, after 21 days of bed rest|Maximum volume of oxygen uptake, Baseline, after 21 days of bed rest|Isometric torque, During a an Isometric Maximum Voluntary Contraction Test on the knee extensors \& flexors, the plantarflexors and dorsiflexors, the elbow extensors \& flexors the Isometric Torque will be measured in Nm., Baseline, after 21 days of bed rest|Muscle fatigue, Baseline, after 21 days of bed rest|Bone metabolism, Baseline, after 2,5,14,21 days of bed rest, 1, 5, 14, 28 days after finishing bed rest|Bone mineral density + content, Baseline, after 21 days of bed rest|Standing balance, Baseline, after 21 days of bed rest|Locomotion, Locomotion will be assessed by Dynamic Gait Index, specific parameters are: total Score and Subscore, Baseline, after 21 days of bed rest|Body mass, Daily for a duration of 35 days|Intracranial pressure, Baseline, after 1,4, 7,10,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21 days of bed rest,1,2,4 days after finishing bed rest|Monitoring of Vitamin K status, Baseline, after 2,5,14,21 days of bed rest, 1, 5 days after finishing bed rest|Fat metabolism, Baseline, after 21 days of bed rest|Glucose metabolism, Baseline, after 21 days of bed rest, 4 days after finishing bed rest|Nitrogen balance, Daily for a duration of 33 days|Energy metabolism, Baseline, after 21 days of bed rest|Glucocorticoid activity, Baseline, after 2,3,7,8,12,13,16,17 days of bed rest, 2,3 days after finishing bed rest|Muscle metabolism, Baseline, after 21 days of bed rest|Acid base balance, Baseline, after 2, 14, 21 days of bed rest, 5 days after finishing bed rest|Sympathetic activity during orthostatic stress, Muscle sympathetic nerve activity is measured by MSNA recording by microneurography technique., Baseline, after 21 days of bed rest|Visual Orientation, Visual Orientation is assessed by 'Oriented Character Recognition Test' and Luminous Line Test.

NCT00138879,Citrulline: A Plasmatic Marker to Assess and Monitor Small Bowel Crohn's Disease Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00138879,,COMPLETED,"Citrulline is an amino acid produced in the intestine and in the liver, but the liver does not contribute significantly to circulating citrulline concentrations. The intestine is thus the only organ that normally releases significant amounts of citrulline into the blood. The investigators have designed a study looking at the value of measuring plasma citrulline concentration in patients with Crohn's disease and short bowel or normal intestinal length. Measuring the plasma citrulline concentration in short bowel patients may help to distinguish between patients who need permanent parenteral feeding from patients with just transient intestinal dysfunction. It may also help the investigators in understanding the small bowel intestinal length remaining and the absorptive integrity. In patients with normal intestinal length and Crohn's disease, it may be a reliable marker of small bowel damage and could be applied to establish therapeutic improvements. It has been demonstrated to strongly correlate (inversely) with severity on intestinal biopsies.

The investigators hypothesise that the plasma citrulline concentration is a marker for small bowel absorptive integrity and an appropriate surrogate for functional length of the small intestine.

NCT03884179,Diagnosis of PCL With EUS-FNA and Cross-sectional Imaging - A Report of Accuracy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03884179,,UNKNOWN,"Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) comprise of a heterogeneous group of entities that are benign, premalignant or malignant. With increased use of modern imaging techniques in recent years, incidentally discovered PCL have become much more common. However, imaging modalities for characterising PCL is a known clinical uncertainty since imaging is capable of detecting these lesions but may often not be able to distinguish malignant from benign lesions. Incorrect assessment of PCL can lead to fatal consequences because a malignant lesion may not be treated and a benign may be unnecessarily resected. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) in the diagnosis of pancreatic cystic lesions compared to cross-sectional imaging modalities (CT/MRI).
